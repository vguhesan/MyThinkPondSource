A few months back, I gave a presentation at Leidos Cloud User Group on the topic of "Understanding Microservices". To my astonishment, we had about 123 folks that attended the presentation. I felt that it's best that I share this knowledge with the world. I have also created a short (and sweet) implementation of Microservices using JavaScript Cote.js library.
