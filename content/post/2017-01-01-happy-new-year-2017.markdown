Take inventory of this past year. Realize what is up to us and what is not up to us.


We can control our emotions, our decisions, our perspectives, and our desires. We have a say in how these things go. These are things that are _up to us_. We can’t control what other people think, the state of the economy, the president elect, the traffic, and so on.




Between the two, we face a choice on what we focus on – what is under our control or what is not.




If we choose to focus on the things that we can control, we can make progress, we can grow and learn and reach our goals.




You have power over your mind – not outside events. Realize this, and you will have strength.








- (summarized from) [Emperor Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius) in [Meditations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations)
