Mapping the End of Malaria by Bill Gates

[![endmalariacampaign](/img/2016/11/endmalariacampaign1.png)](/img/2016/11/endmalariacampaign1.png)The article discusses two important points:



 	
  1. How Malaria is putting mosquitoes as the #1 deadliest lifeform that kills humans? (Interestingly humans are the #2 lifeform that kills our own species) And what has/is being done to change this through the Gates Foundation in the developing countries. As well as the positive, measurable changes that can be seen from the last decade.

 	
  2. Addresses a underlying issue on foreign aid. Does it work? And this point drives us close to home during this upcoming election in a few days as each American will cast a vote for the next president.


Here are some key points taken from Bill Gates'  blog [[GatesNotes.com](http://GatesNotes.com)] on this article.


<blockquote>Malaria is the key reason mosquitoes are the [deadliest animal in the world](http://b-gat.es/2dJLpHD). **Rigorous new data show that the malaria death rate in sub-Saharan Africa has declined by a stunning 57% since 2000**. With almost 500,000 children still dying of malaria every year, we obviously have a long way to go. But cutting the death rate by more than half is a miracle. It’s one of the greatest success stories in the history of global health.

First, we’ll need new classes of drugs that completely clear malaria parasites from the body

Second, we need new tools that can prevent malaria transmission.

Today, this is no longer a lonely fight. More than 50 countries have joined together to mobilize billions of dollars through [The Global Fund](http://b-gat.es/2dLadxG). ...these resources are coming not just from wealthy countries. African countries such as Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, and Zimbabwe are contributing...In fact, African countries are now, for the first time ever, mobilizing more of their own resources for malaria than they’re receiving from donors.

So the next time you hear skeptics charging that foreign aid doesn’t work, point to malaria. Foreign assistance has not chased away local resources. On the contrary, it’s encouraged African nations to step up their own health efforts. And the results have been nothing short of remarkable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>[![asokathegreat](/img/2016/11/asokathegreat.jpg)](/img/2016/11/asokathegreat.jpg)+ No society can prosper if it aims at making things easier-instead it should aim at making people stronger.
+ All men are my children. What I desire for my own children, and I desire their welfare and happiness both in this world and the next, that I desire for all men. You do not understand to what extent I desire this, and if some of you do understand, you do not understand the full extent of my desire.

- [Asoka The Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka) (Indian Emperor waged a bitter destructive war, killed indiscriminately. In one of the battles, realized that war was not the means to the end but love for his people and all life (human or animals) is the real path. Reformed his empire on strength, love and peace. Became one the greatest emperors to rule major portions of India in a path of nonviolence.)</blockquote>
