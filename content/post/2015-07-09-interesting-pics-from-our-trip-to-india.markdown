Interesting pics from our trip to India

I took this shot from a higher elevation against the backdrop of the [Gopura](https://www.google.com/search?q=citadel&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#q=What+is+Gopura) (vimana) of our ancestral family temple in Kaniyur, Tamil Nadu, India. Google photo animation stitched the pictures to create the animation.
