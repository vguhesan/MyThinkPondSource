If you are looking to improve your productivity when you are working on a mindful task then[ Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) is the way.

It's a technique where you sit for twenty-five minutes at a time focused on one task. At the end of the cycle, you take a "required" short break and then start on your next cycle.

Why twenty-five minutes and not thirty? If you find out why, let me know.

Well, CÃ©lio Cidral Junior at [http://www.tomighty.org/ ](http://www.tomighty.org/)has created a desktop timer that helps you organize and execute your tasks using the Pomodoro technique.

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

Cheers
