Found a neat little browser download helper tool. It's one that I'll be using and it's definitely a tool to add to your browser toolkit bookmarks.

Ever been in a situation where you wanted to download a file at the office but the particular extension is not allowed at the company. Well, this tool might help you in those situations. It's called Grab-N-Zip ([http://www.GrabNZip.com](http://bit.ly/5trOZS))

You enter your URL to the file that you are trying to "grab" from the internet. And you specify the file-name under which you would like to receive the file and the site does the rest of the work for you. For example, at some sites they have downloads available as exe's and I'm blocked from downloading those files. Well, this neat little tool comes in handy. It sends me the file as a zip or jpg or any other extension that's supported.

Check it out! It might come in handy one of these days!
