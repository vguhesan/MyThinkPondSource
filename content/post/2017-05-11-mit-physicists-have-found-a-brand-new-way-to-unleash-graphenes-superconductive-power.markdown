<blockquote>Â Physicists have found a new way to turn 'wonder material' graphene into a ridiculously powerful superconductor, capable of shuttling electricity with zero resistance.

That's important, because if we could find a way to achieve superconductivity at room temperature, it would lead to vastly more efficient electronic devices, not to mention power lines. Right now, energy companies are losing about 7 percent of their energy as heat as a result of resistance in the grid.

In the latest study, physicists from MIT took a flake of graphene and sandwiched it between aluminium, which behaves like a superconductor at low temperatures.</blockquote>
