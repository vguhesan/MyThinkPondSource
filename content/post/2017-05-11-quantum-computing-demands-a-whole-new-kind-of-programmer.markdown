<blockquote>[![](/img/2017/05/quantum-computing-whole-new-kind-of-programmer-1-1068x601.jpg)](https://singularityhub.com/2017/05/09/quantum-computing-demands-a-whole-new-kind-of-programmer/)Quantum computers finally seem to be coming of age with promises of “quantum supremacy” by the end of the year. But there’s a problem—very few people know how to work them. The bold claim of achieving "quantum supremacy" came on the back of Google unveiling a new quantum chip design. The hyperbolic phrase essentially means building a quantum device that can perform a calculation impossible for any conventional computer.

The technology has a major challenge to overcome. Programming these devices is much harder than programming conventional computers.

For a start, building algorithms for these machines requires a certain level of understanding about the quantum physics that gives qubits their special properties. While you don’t need an advanced physics degree to get your head around it, it is a big departure from traditional computer programming.</blockquote>
