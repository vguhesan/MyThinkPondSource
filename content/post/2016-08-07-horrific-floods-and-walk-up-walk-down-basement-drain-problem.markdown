This past week, Ellicott City, Maryland had one of the worst floods in a long time. You can see some of the devastation that it has caused in this[ link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/07/31/video-and-photo-horrific-flooding-in-ruined-ellicott-city-md/). Fortunately, only my basement had a little bit of flooding. But interestingly, this has been the second flooding in over a month. This made me question the drain at the bottom of the walk-down/walk-up basement.

Here is a picture of the drain at the bottom of the stairwell.

I have been clearing the dirt and leaves regularly but when there is a storm, the water floods down from the adjacent wall bringing with it debris which end up clogging the drain hole.

As a first fix, I tried this from HomeDepot. It's called a drain trap. (shown below)

[![trap1](/img/2016/08/trap1.jpg)](/img/2016/08/trap1.jpg)Again this was good but it did not solve the problem. So I decided to try something different. I needed a frame that was at least 1-in tall giving the dirt a place to settle around it and not flow into the cavity. I also need it to be sturdy where the weight of the frame keeps the mesh/trap down to the ground even in moderate to severe thunderstorms. I searched online for a solution and after spending quite a bit of time searching through blogs, I decided to build one myself.

So here is the finished product:

Here are the materials I used to build this:



 	
  * Chicken-coup mesh grill

 	
  * four L-brackets

 	
  * two tree stump posts cut to the size of the chicken-coup (to create a 1in thick frame)

 	
  * Long plastic corner bead to keep the grill corners from cutting into me with rust over time

 	
  * outdoor screen plastic to to add a second layer of filtering

 	
  * Staple gun

 	
  * Silicone used for household seals

Here is the frame upside down. It's basically the wood is framed in against the chicken coop metal grill.

Added the finer outdoor plastic screen-door screen on top and kept them together with the staple gun. And the last step is to create a seal between the pavement floor and the frame.

And voila a gutter guard (that can hopefully withstand some rain). Keeping my fingers crossed.

I will keep this blog post updated as I improvise on my custom made gutter guard. Hopefully others can follow this blueprint and build their own gutter-guards.

Cheers.
