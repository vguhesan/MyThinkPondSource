DevOps Days (<a href='https://devopsdays.org/' target='_blank'>DevOpsDays.org</a>) is a global phenomenon going on each year. This year due to COVID-19 lock down, the event was hosted online and in partnership with various meet-ups in the I-95 (<a href='https://www.google.com/maps/dir/New+York,+NY/Virginia/@39.9146796,-83.2817915,6.65z/am=t/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!2m2!1d-74.0059728!2d40.7127753!1m5!1m1!1s0x884cd670bdbcb2cd:0xc04e4149b746a695!2m2!1d-78.6568942!2d37.4315734' target='_blank'>interstate 95</a>) corridor. The idea of a <a href='devops95.com' target='_blank'>DevOps95</a> grew out of the series of towns and suburbs connecting on the interstate I-95 route on East-Coast. It is an one-day virtual meet-up (on Zoom) where industry leaders from GitOps and DevOps shared their knowledge with others. This was my first DevOps meeting with the Columbia, Maryland DevOps group (Burak T. - Thanks for sharing this event with me). It was a very educational event. The complete event lasted over 12+ hours with various presenters. You can view the complete 12-hour event <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3le3CSv9xQ' target='_blank'>here</a> on YouTube. 

## Getting Started With Kubernetes by Tiffany Jernigan ##

I was lucky enough to attended the <a href='https://www.meetup.com/devops-columbia/' target='_blank'>DevOps Columbia, Maryland Meetup</a> portion of the online event where <a href='https://twitter.com/tiffanyfayj' target='_blank'>Tiffany Jernigan</a> (Senior Developer Advocate from <a href='https://www.vmware.com/' target='_blank'>VMware</a>) gave a talk on "Getting Started with Kubernetes". 

Since I enjoyed this tech-talk, I felt that it will benefit others looking into Kubernetes. I clipped just the portion of the "Getting Started with Kubernetes" tech-talk (approximately 1.2 hrs. long) from the 12-hour segment and posted it on YouTube with relevant links back to the presenter. The credit for this goes to Tiffany and the Columbia DevOps/DevOps95 group. I am essentially facilitating by shortening the video. Additionally, as I was reviewing the tech-talk I created the mind-maps for this segment. The mind-maps should help the busy folks (and for developers that prefer something to follow along as Tiffany steps you through the details. The mind-map is available both in PDF and PNG file for easy consumption.)

If you can spare about 1hr and 20 minutes, it will be well worth your time in learning the basics on how Kubernetes works and the various components. Let's go to the video.
