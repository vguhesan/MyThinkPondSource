#### The spherical genius of the Hüttlin Kugelmotor




<blockquote>Electrical motors are an energy-efficient method for driving vehicles but battery technology is simply not going to advance quickly enough for all-electric vehicles to be a practical reality for most uses anytime soon. The near and mid-term future is undoubtedly a combination of compact combustion engine generators charging dense battery packs that drive electric motors - the "range extender" option.

After nearly twenty years of development another "range extender" candidate is going through final testing and it is a work of elegant genius - Dr. Herbert Hüttlin's Kugelmotor.</blockquote>
