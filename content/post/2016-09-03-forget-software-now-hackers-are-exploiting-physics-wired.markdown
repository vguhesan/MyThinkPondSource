[Forget Software—Now Hackers Are Exploiting Physics | WIRED] is good,have a look at it!


<blockquote>targeting the actual electricity that comprises bits of data in computer memory. Technique is called 'RowHammer'. The trick works by running a program on the target computer, which repeatedly overwrites a certain row of transistors in its DRAM flash memory, “hammering” it until a rare glitch occurs: Electric charge leaks from the hammered row of transistors into an adjacent row. The leaked charge then causes a certain bit in that adjacent row of the computer’s memory to flip from one to zero or vice versa. That bit flip gives you access to a privileged level of the computer’s operating system.</blockquote>
