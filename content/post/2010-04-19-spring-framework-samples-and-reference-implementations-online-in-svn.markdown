Sometimes it's good to look at the svn repository for the reference sample that Spring Framework provides. 

Here's a quick link for that URL:

https://src.springframework.org/svn/spring-samples/

You can traverse through it via a HTTP(s) browser or you can download the latest samples via tools like TortiseSVN.

Here is a list of some of the projects samples that are available today:

spring-samples - Revision 431: /

    * configuration-basic/
    * jpetstore/
    * mvc-ajax/
    * mvc-basic/
    * petcare/
    * petclinic/
    * petclinic-groovy/
    * spring-travel/
    * task-basic/
    * templates/
    * tutorials/

Hopefully this article will be beneficial for someone who is trying to get familiar with Spring Framework.

Cheers.
