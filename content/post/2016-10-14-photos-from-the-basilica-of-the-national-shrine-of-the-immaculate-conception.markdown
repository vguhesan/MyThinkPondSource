[![nationalshrine](/img/2016/10/nationalshrine1.png)](/img/2016/10/nationalshrine1.png)Recently visited the Basilica of the National Shrine and each time I visit this beautiful place I'm spellbound. It is one of the hidden gems to visit when you are visiting the capital. Here are some pictures from my recent visit.

[Click here](https://goo.gl/photos/NbPSGhtm8wgKnfvV9) for the photos from the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Michigan Avenue, Washington, DC. The beautiful murals are a work of art! Each and every space intricately carved and shaped full of love and celebration of the divine! It is one of my favorite places of worship!

I highly recommend everyone to visit.

Cheers!
