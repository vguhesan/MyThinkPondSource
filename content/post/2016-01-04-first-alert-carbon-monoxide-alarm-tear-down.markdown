One of my First Alert Carbon Monoxide Alarm's expired. This gave me an opportunity to look inside and see what's inside this little gadget.

Here is a picture of the tear-down for those who are interested:

First Alert - Single Station Carbon Monoxide Alarm - model #: CO614

The [specification for the carbon-monoxide sensor](http://www.figarosensor.com/products/5042pdf.pdf) used in this model can be found [here](http://www.figarosensor.com/products/5042pdf.pdf).

Here is a [list of alternative carbon-monoxide sensors](http://www.figarosensor.com/products/sensor/target-gas/co/) from Figaro.

Here is an [alternative](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9403) available at SparkFun. (Air Quality MQ135 sensor).

The second picture can be zoomed in by opening the image on a separate window.

Cheers.
