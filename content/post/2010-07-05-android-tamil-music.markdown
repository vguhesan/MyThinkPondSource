If you or someone owns an Android based phone such as Nexus One, HTC Droid, or HTC Incredible and would like to listen to some Tamil music streams. I've setup a server that streams live 24x7 latest tamil music.

[After posting it I've had comments about some usability issues by using the default MP3 player in Nexus One. So I'm revising the steps.]

1. Under Android Market Place, search for an application "A Online Radio". This app or others supports streaming from an Icecast2 server. Install it.

2. Add the following URL into the application.

Latest Tamil: http://music.iniyatamil.com:8000/MudhalMalai
Old Sivaji (Classical) Songs: http://music.iniyatamil.com:8000/endrumsivaji

3. It should begin streaming.

If you have a VLC Media player (or any streaming compatible player) you can point to this stream as well.

If you run into any issues, send me a note via this blog and I'll get it working. Also if you know of others who speak Tamil that might enjoy this stream, pass it along.

Enjoy
