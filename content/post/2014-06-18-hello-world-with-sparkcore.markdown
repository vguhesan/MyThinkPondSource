Finally got my [SparkCore](https://www.spark.io/), an Arduino built with on-board WiFi (no need for a Arduino WiFi shield). This version is a different take on the "Internet of Things" and "Build internet-connected hardware"

Here's a picture of the Spark connected to the WiFi running my first HelloWorld app downloaded directly from the Spark IDE to the core.

Looking forward to building some designs around it! To learn more about [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) and [SparkCore](https://www.spark.io/) visit their corresponding sites.

Happy Blogging!
