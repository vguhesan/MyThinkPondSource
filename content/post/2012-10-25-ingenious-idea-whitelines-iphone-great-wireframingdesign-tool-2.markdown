I’m an Android user and today I’m wishing I owned a iPhone or iPad after seeing this idea…

It’s called [Whitelines](http://whitelines.se/).

To create a printable paper that uses “white-lines” instead of the usual “solid-black/blue lines” and to take it a step further to add some scan marks such that a iPhone can take a digital picture of your notes and make it available online. The possibilities are endless.

Here how the process works:



	
  1. Download/Purchase and/or Print Whitelines template using your laser printer.

	
  2. Take your notes or draw or sketch using the Whitelines paper.

	
  3. Using the Whitelines iPhone App ([available here](http://whitelines.se/link/)), point at the paper and it takes a photo.

	
  4. Connect with your SpringPad/Evernote/Dropbox or email to share and upload your digital versions of your notes.


Quite ingenious! Can’t wait for a similar app on the Android marketplace.

**Con:**
Unfortunately Whitelines (UK Company) at this present time only offers downloadable print paper sizes that are A4 or A5 standard and no US Paper Standards like US-Legal and US-Letter.

**Idea:**
Anyone interested in starting a company in the USA to offer the US-Letter and US-Legal paper sizes??? Contact me. I would love to partner up to do this. ![:-)](http://www.mythinkpond.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
