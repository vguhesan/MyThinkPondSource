Based on this YouTube video (in Tamil Language): [https://youtu.be/t3_RqF9aCpo](https://youtu.be/t3_RqF9aCpo)

On "Simple Exercises to Reduce Belly Fat in Weeks".

When joting down notes from videos or reading, I usually end up with a mindmap on each and every topic and since I enjoyed this video and the exercises, I thought I'd clean up my mind map and share it with the world so that if there are others running into this video (author of the video speaks in the Tamil language) that are non-tamil speaking or English speaking folks, they can quickly get the synopsis of the video and benefit from the exercises.

I hope these exercises are useful for you.
