CERN researchers succeeded in their goal of [measuring the spectrum of light](http://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-have-observed-the-light-spectrum-of-antimatter-for-first-time) emitted from hydrogen's mirror particle, antihydrogen.

Now the researchers have detailed evidence of the structure of antihydrogen using spectroscopy...
