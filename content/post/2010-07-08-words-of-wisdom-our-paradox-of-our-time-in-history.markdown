The paradox of our time in history is that we  have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider Freeways , but narrower  viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less.  We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less  time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less  judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less  wellness.

We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too  little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too  tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.

We  have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too  much, love too seldom, and hate too often.

We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added  years to life not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and  back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We  conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but  not better things.

We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the  atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan  more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We  build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies  than ever, but we communicate less and less.

These are the times of fast foods and slow  digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow  relationships. These are the days of two incomes  but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway  morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do  everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is  much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when  technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose  either to share this insight, or to just hit delete...

**Remember; spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not  going to be around forever.**

**Remember, say a kind word to someone  who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow  up and leave your side.**

**Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is  the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a  cent.**

**Remember, to say, 'I love you' to your partner and your  loved ones, but most of all mean it. An embrace  will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of  you.**

**Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that  person will not be there again.**

**Give time to love, give time to  speak! And give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.**

**AND  ALWAYS REMEMBER:**

**Life is not measured by the number of  breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.
**
