My daughter found a four-leaf clover the day before Saint Patrick's Day! Talk about luck!

[four-leaf clover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-leaf_clover)

According to the Wikipedia article:


<blockquote>It has been estimated that there are approximately 10,000 three-leaf clovers for every one four-leaf clover</blockquote>
