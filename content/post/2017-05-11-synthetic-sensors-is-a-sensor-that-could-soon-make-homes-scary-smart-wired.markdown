<blockquote>**Synthetic Sensors** : a simple device that plugs into an electrical outlet and connects everything in the room. It can capture all of the the environmental data needed to transform a wide variety of ordinary household objects into smart devices.

Plug the module into an electrical outlet and it becomes the eyes and ears of the room, its 10 embedded sensors logging information like sound, humidity, electromagnetic noise, motion, and light (the researchers excluded a camera for privacy reasons). Machine learning algorithms translate that data into context-specific information about what’s happening in the room.</blockquote>


More importantly, I like this project because I've spotted a Particle Photon embedded at the core of the Synthetic Sensor.
