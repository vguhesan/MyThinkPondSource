Developed [DDNInsight](https://www.ddn.com/products/storage-monitoring-ddn-insight/), an Enterprise Monitoring and Management Solution for all of the DDN products.\n- Enterprise Managing Architect [DrFirst](http://www.drfirst.com/e-prescribing-for-controlled-substances.jsp) engineering an e-prescribing platform for controlled substances.\n- Thirteen years at [Aon-Hewitt](http://www.aon.com/human-capital-consulting/benefits-admin/default.jsp) developed a premier suite of solutions for Human Resource and Benefits Management under the name RealLifeBenefits.\n\nI have been lucky and blessed to be diversified in a wide variety of sectors including GitOps, DevOps, Finance, Investing, Mutual Fund Management, Insurance, Health Care, Rx Management, Ticket Broker Network, Publishing, High Performance Computing, Storage, Distributed File Systems (GPFS & Lustre) Monitoring & Management and last but more recently - Software Development Code Quality Metrics, Analytics and Reporting.\n\n\n**Family:** wife, two daughters and a puppy (very blessed indeed)\n\n**Cultural Heritage and Ancestry:**\n\n- First and foremost - the why? Being the first-generation immigrant to be transplanted abroad, preserving the cultural identity and heritage is important to me and my future generations to come. But I stand against any social-cutural-racial-liguistic-caste-religious zealotry or divide that exists within all cultures. I am with the founders of this country when they said - “_We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men (and women) are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness._” (_to include women although they should have added 'women' back then as well. Crazy times!_) and hoping that one day we can grow as a society to say \"all life\". We are ALL beautiful creatures - unique in our abilities and talents, each worthy of praise and recognition. We stand on the shoulders of giants (our ancestors) -- continually lifting us and propelling us forward to where we are today!\n- Language: Thamizh (Tamil/தமிழ்) - (proud to be speaking) one among the longest-surviving, continuously written and spoken -- \"classical\" languages from the antiquity era. Etymologically speaking, it is interesting and surprising to note that words like \"candy\" (கண்டு - kandu), \"cry\" (கரை - karai), \"cash\" (காசு - kasu), \"eight\" (எட்டு - ettu), \"victory\" (வெற்றி - vetri), \"terra\" (தரை - tharai), \"name\" (நாமம் - naamam) and many more have originated from the Thamizh (தமிழ்) language.\n- Family from வேட்டைக்காரன்புதூர் - உடுமலை - கணியூர் மாவட்டம் (From Vetaikaranputhur - Udamalpet - Kanuyur circle/location/geolocation) - பாண்டிய வேளாளர் பிள்ளை சங்கம் (descendant from this group). It will be an interesting project to see a geneology map overlaid with liguistics, clutural and geolocation data to see movement of people, beliefs and cultures.\n\n## Family\n\n\n\n    {{}}\n    {{}}\n\n\n\n**Blog Mascot:**\n{{}} **Mr.Owl**\n\nOwls are considered to be one of the most mysterious of all birds. They are believed to be part of the spirit world that brings both men and the gods together as one. Greek mythology often talks about the goddess Athena who was an owl. Athena is talked about in a good light with the ideals of art, wisdom, beauty, and skillfulness. In some other cultures, owls represent as keepers of wisdom and knowledge and so I felt that Mr.Owl suits best to be the mascot of this website (as the \"keeper of the knowledge contained within My-Think-Pond\") So as you bookmark this website and when you revisit - you will be reminded of Mr.Owl :-) (Mr.Owl is always hiding in plain sight between the lines in this blog - if you find him - wish him well!) One more thing... Be kind to all animals!\n\n## Places of Work / Contributions\n\nThere is a saying - _\"If you want to measure a persons worth, measure the lives that they have touched!\"_. Although, I truly cannot measure the lives that I have personally touched, I can indirectly measure the contributions I have made to humanity through my service over the years to the wonderful companies, organizations, and entities that I have had the privileged to work for. And the countless companies that have used my products and the services that I have helped shape over the years.\n\nBelow is a list of organizations that I have worked for:\n(current & past - in no special order)\\*\n\n- Federal Government\n- Leidos\n- Eliassen Group\n- Data Direct Networks\n- Systems Alliance\n- Random House Publishing / Penguin Random House\n- United States Fidelity & Guarantee Company (USF&G) / St. Paul / Travelers Insurance Company\n- T. Rowe Price Investments, Inc.\n- Cap Gemini Group / Ernst & Young / Sogeti\n- Rewards Plus of America / Hewitt / Aon-Hewitt / Aon\n- DrFirst\n- Campus Book Hound\n- Advanced Ticketing and Management System / ASC Tickets\n- Secure Stax\n\nDuring COVID-19 (which everyone in my generation in this century will remember for sure), I began to realize how small and fragile we are in this universe. So whenever I needed a little motivation, I look to this wall for inspiration! I call it: \"My Wall of Motivation\":\n\n{{}}\n\n## A Footnote till we meet again...\n\nI hope you find my collections of thoughts, ideas and journal useful.

Although most J2EE features are not available in the community edition, one of the features that did like was the [Scala Plugin](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/SCA/Scala+Plugin+for+IntelliJ+IDEA).\n\nAfter I downloaded it and added the scala plug-in, I was very impressed with the tool. I have been using Eclipse (a little Netbeans) for most of my Java development and although I have tried the scala plugin that's available for Eclipse, I wasn't all that impressed. But the plug-in for IntelliJ was well worth the try.\n\nSo far it's been very positive experience. Attached below is a screen-shot of a sample Scala Wicket \"Hello World\". As you can see the syntax highlighting is awesome.\n\n![sample scala code](http://mythinkpond.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/sample_scala_code1.jpg)\n\n**Update from November 09, 2009 [Issues with the latest Scala Plugin]\n**\n\nA few folks have expressed concern that after their plug-in update (version: 0.3.108 from Nov 06, 2009) their Scala facelet failed to load. Well, I updated today and had the same issue. Rather than trying to fix the root cause, I felt that it's better for now to get IntelliJ working again. So here's what I did to fix my Scala Plugin issue.\n\nClose intelliJ (if you haven't already done so) but make sure you have installed the broken scala plugin.\n\nIn windows, the plugins are located here:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\\\.IntelliJIdea90\\config\\plugins\nI went to the location where I can download the earlier version of the Scala Plugin:\nhttp://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?id=1347\nDownloaded the version: 0.3.75 manually and unzipped it's contents under above \"...\\plugins\\Scala\\lib\\\" folder. This replaces all the files under the lib directory with the earlier version.\n\nStart intelliJ and you should be golden. This is a quick fix until the issues are resolved.\n\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider signing up for my RSS feed or Email Newsletter. See links on the right side.\n",

And you will notice that this replaces the existing HTML frame (if you had served the original PDF from a website) or window with the new document making it hard to navigate. In these cases, you would prefer to open the link in the PDF onto it's own new window.\n\nWell here how you do it...\n\nSo within Acrobat Professional (not Acrobat Reader), you will have options to add a URL or link. Instead, you can add a \"Javascript\" code as the action item on a link. And enter the following as the code that you use:\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\n\napp.launchURL(\"https://mythinkpond.wordpress.com/\", true);\n\n[/sourcecode]\nwhere the a \"true\" in the second attribute tells Acrobat reader to open the link in a new window and a \"false\" will open it up in the existing window.\n\nTo learn more about the Javascript API supported in the Acrobat Reader try this link:\n[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf)\n\nOr this link: [Acrobat Developer Center](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript.html)\n\nHappy Coding!\n",

Well I did some digging around to find out so I'm documenting it here for others who might be facing the same challenges as they discover Apache Wicket.\n\n**Problem**:\nYou have pages in Wicket that are HTML with \"Wicket\" tags. But then you might want to point to resources such as CSS style sheets or JavaScript that's part of a page. Here's an example of a typical JSP page:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"html\"]\n\n\n\n@import \\\" + request.getContextPath() + \"/styles/site.css\\\";\n\n...\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nWell, the above code works when you have a JSP page that gets compiled at run-time before being served. But in the case of Wicket, it does not. So how do you handle such situations?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n**Step-1:** Add \"\" and \"\" between your HTML page like this:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"html\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\n**Step-2:** Get the ServletContext and in turn the Context-Path for the web application in your Java/Scala code.\n\nFor application servers implementing Servlet 2.5 and above: (Tomcat 6.x implements Servlet 2.5)\n[sourcecode language=\"java\"]\n\nServletContext servletContext = WebApplication.get().getServletContext();\nString contextPath = servletContext.getContextPath();\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nFor application servers implementing Servlet 2.4: (Tomcat 5.5x implements Servlet 2.4)\n[sourcecode language=\"java\"]\n\nString contextPath = getWebRequestCycle().getWebRequest().getHttpServletRequest().getContextPath();\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\n\n\nWhat's the difference? Well, in Servlet 2.5, a new method was added \nString javax.servlet.ServletContext.getContextPath()\nBut if you are deploying your code in an earlier Tomcat or other application servers that do not implement Servlet 2.5, you will be at a disadvantage. So in those cases, use the other approach. \n\n\n\n\n\n**Step-3:** In your Java/Scala Wicket code, just as you add labels or other components to your page you can add the following:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"java\"]\n\nadd(new StringHeaderContributor(\"@import \\\"\" + contextPath + \"/styles/site.css\\\";\"));\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nSo here's what happens. In step-2, we created a variable called \"contextPath\" with the Servlet Context Path as it's value. And when you add a \"StringHeaderContributor\", it adds an entry into the pages header. It's that simple!\n\nSo now after your browser goes through the request you now have the correct \"ContextPath\" inserted into your application:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"html\"]\n\n@import \"/sampleapp/styles/site.css\";\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nAfter I posted the article I noticed I had left out a few additional details on this topic. If you are\nadding resources such as images on your page, Wicket provides you with a easy way to do this. There is a org.apache.wicket.markup.html.image.ContextImage class that you can use to create image html tags in your\npage.\n\nIn your Java or Scala class you can do the following:\n[sourcecode language=\"html\"]\n\nadd(new ContextImage(\"logo\", contextPath + \"/i/logo.jpg\"))\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nand in your html (Wicket) page you can add a html-wicket element like this:\n[sourcecode language=\"html\"]\n\n\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nWicket matches the wicket:id \"logo\" with the element added in the code and displays the image with the correct context-path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider signing up for my RSS feed or Email Newsletter.

Here's how:\n\n1. Modify your web.xml to define your servlet as well as your Wicket application \"ignorePaths\" init-param:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"xml\"]\n\n\n\n Wicket Example\n \n MyApplication\n org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WicketFilter\n \n applicationClassName\n com.gu.MyApplication\n \n \n wicket.configuration\n deployment\n \n \n ignorePaths\n images/,s/\n \n \n \n MyApplication\n /*\n \n \n SomeServlet\n com.gu.SomeServlet\n \n \n SomeServlet\n /s/koolkat.do\n \n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nThe first observation is that Wicket is running as a Filter and not a Servlet. Second, the init-param - \"ignorePaths\" says that anything in the \"/images\" and \"/s/*\" will be ignored by Wicket Filter and passed along downstream.\n\n2. Next in your Wicket Form, within your onSubmit method override you can do the following:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"Java\"]\nclass TestForm extends Form(id){\n  @override\n  public TestForm(String id, SomeFormModel ghfm)\n  {\n    //Code removed\n  }\n  @override\n  public onSubmit()\n  {\n    String url = \"/s/koolkat.do\"; //some url within the same web-context\n    getRequestCycle().setRequestTarget(new RedirectRequestTarget(url));\n  }\n}\n[/sourcecode]\n\nNotice that the url field **does not** contain the \"ContextPath\". Wicket takes care of that in the background. On the other hand, suppose you wanted to redirect to a URL ourside of your web context or to an external site then you would set the variable like this.\n\n[sourcecode language=\"Java\"]\nString url = \"http://mythinkpond.wordpress.com/2009/11/13/forwarding-to-a-url-from-wicket/\";  //or\nurl = \"http://myserver:port/othercontext/someurl\";  \n[/sourcecode]\n\nOn some rare occasions, you might want to get the servlet Request Dispatcher to forward a request. For that it gets a little tricky.\n\n-- In your  class you want to grab the \"HttpServletResponse\". I've been unsuccessful in getting it in the  class.\n[sourcecode language=\"Java\"]\nclass xyz extends WebPage{\n  public xyz()\n  {\n     HttpServletResponse response = getWebRequestCycle().getWebResponse().getHttpServletResponse();\n     //additional code\n     xyxForm thisForm = new xyzForm(thisModel, response);\n  }\n}\n\nclass xyzForm extends Form{\n  HttpServletResponse response;\n\n  public xyzForm(xyzModel model, HttpServletResponse thisResponse)\n  {\n     response = thisResponse;\n  }\n    \n   public onSubmit() {\n     HttpServletRequest request = getWebRequest().getHttpServletRequest();\n     //additional code here\n     getWebRequest().getHttpServletRequest().getRequestDispatcher(url).forward(request, response);\n  }\n}\n[/sourcecode]\n\n\n\nPlease note that the above code is pseudo-code and not actual code because I was writing it in Scala and not Java. But for the audience, I'm trying to express it in Java so that it can have the greatest impact.\n\n\n\nThat's it! Happy Coding!\n\n\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider signing up for my RSS feed or Email Newsletter. See links on the right side.\n",

There's noting wrong with your jar file or the Java class. The actual problem is in the next line, namely \"class net.jcip.annotations.ThreadSafe not found.\" It's a class-not-found error.\n\nSo if you encounter a \"broken\" error when compiling Scala - the following line after the broken message can help you find the real error. It can save you a whole lot of head-aches and chasing the wrong tail.\n\n\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider signing up for my RSS feed or Email Newsletter. See links on the right side.\n",

Well, this tool might help you in those situations. It's called Grab-N-Zip ([http://www.GrabNZip.com](http://bit.ly/5trOZS))\n\nYou enter your URL to the file that you are trying to \"grab\" from the internet. And you specify the file-name under which you would like to receive the file and the site does the rest of the work for you. For example, at some sites they have downloads available as exe's and I'm blocked from downloading those files. Well, this neat little tool comes in handy. It sends me the file as a zip or jpg or any other extension that's supported.\n\nCheck it out! It might come in handy one of these days!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

My experience with Brix has been a few months. The creators of Wicket and Brix-cms know a lot more about the internals and the best way to set them up. My goal is to expose you to the knowledge I have gained and offer you one of the ways in which you can set things up in a scalable environment.\n\n**Installment #1:**\n\nToday (Monday, March 8th, 2010) marks an important day for [Brix Portal and Content Manager](http://code.google.com/p/brix-cms/) (called Brix-cms) - It's announcement of it's version 1.1.0 release. One of the [comments](http://groups.google.com/group/brix-cms-discuss/msg/4c3704ca6fb5444c?hl=en) made by a Brix supporter is that it lacks documentation and tutorials. So this is my attempt to share some of my experiences with Brix and ow to setup Brix backed by a Jackrabbit cluster.\n\nSo let's get started:\n\n**1. What is Brix-CMS?**\nWell, it's a Wicket based content manager framework. It contains a content manager and a portal that comes bundled in a neat little package.\n\n**2. What can you do with it?**\nPretty much anything that requires a clean consistent templating and rendering engine backed by a content manager to manage the content.\n\n**3. Why would you use Brix-cms when there are other content managers out there?**\nWell, if your company is focused on developing your applications in Wicket then pluging in Brix-cms makes integrating your application with a portal front-end a breeze. But even if you are developing your application in another framework such as SpringMVC or Struts-2, you can still plug into the Brix-cms using portlets or override the Brix-Demo Servlet to embed your plug to your application. Or if you are looking for a simple easy to use Portal with a Content Manager - then Brix can get you there quick. [Alfresco ](http://www.alfresco.com/)is the other content manager in this space but has more document management functionality and workflow built around their product but also backed by JCR. I will explain more about the JCR shortly. One of the other paid solution is from a company called Day Software (They have been instrumental in the JCR specification). And their product is called [Web Content Management](http://www.day.com/day/en/products/web_content_management.html). But I can't speak on that because I am not all that familiar with their product line.\n\n**4. What makes Brix-cms better than other content manager portals out there?**\nWhen the \"Internet\" became the beast that it is today, there was need for portals - a centralized place to get all the information about a company, a product, a key set of services, etc. And so to meet the demand people built portals in various languages such as PHP, Perl, Java, etc. And each used the benefits of each language to meet the demand. When Java was used, people wrote portal pages using JSP's. Where each page consisted of a JSP with content embedded in them - persisted to the file system. The next generation of these portal demanded a non-developer to add/edit and delete content. So so began the need for content managers with file based back-end that kept this content. The next generation needed the same versatility but the content was stored in a database making it scalable. But then each implementation had their own way of fetching and retrieving this content from the back end. Well, a solution was needed to allow a clear consistent way to fetch and manage this content from a persistent storage - the solution was  [Java Content Repository](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository_API_for_Java) (JCR). The Java consortium just recently released version JCR-2.0.  According to Wikipedia,\n\n\nContent Repository API for Java (JCR) is a specification for a Java platform API for accessing content repositories in a uniform manner. A JCR is a type of Object Database tailored to the storage, searching, and retrieval of hierarchical data. The JCR API grew out of the needs of content management systems, which require storage of documents and other binary objects with associated metadata; however, the API is applicable to many additional types of application. In addition to object storage, the JCR provides: APIs for versioning of data; transactions; observation of changes in data; and import or export of data to XML in a standard way.\n\n\nSo with the industry looking for a clean and concise way to save, manage and retrieve data - the solution was JCR. So people developing these portals and content managers can use a common concise way to work with the content. So now we need someone or something that implements a java content repository. And that brings us to the next guy in the puzzle, namely [Apache Jackrabbit](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/). Apache Jackrabbit implements the JCR 1.0 (and JCR 2.0) specification. And guess who uses this Jackrabbit - bingo - Brix-cms. So now I hope you can see the powerhouse behind Brix-cms. Basically content (page content, templates, images, pdf's, and other binary content) within Brix-cms are all saved within the JCR (Jackrabbit) repository and fetched on demand using some clever techniques to render on the front-end Portal. I hope this little trip down memory lane has shown you how important the various parts of the puzzle play out in making Brix-cms, a powerful solution. Enough said, moving on.\n\nIn a typical mid-level or enterprise organization - scalability, redundancy and fail-over  all become the mantra that we use on a daily basis. So my objective here is to show you how to get started with Brix development and on one of the ways you can build a solution that allows you to scale, provide redundancy and fail-over support.\n\n_**Brix-cms - First glances.**_\nGoto [Brix-cms Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/brix-cms/downloads/list) (http://code.google.com/p/brix-cms/downloads/list) and download the latest war available from them.

When you point to the application at\n[http://locahost:8080/brixdemo](http://locahost:8080/brixdemo) you get this:\n\n\n[![](http://mythinkpond.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/brix-defaultpage.jpg)](http://mythinkpond.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/brix-defaultpage.jpg)\n\n\nAnd when you click on the \"Admin\" link you get to the content manager portion of Brix-cms.\n\n\n[![](http://mythinkpond.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/brix-cmgr.jpg)](http://mythinkpond.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/brix-cmgr.jpg)\n\n\nSince our focus is to gain a better understanding on setting up and configuring Jackrabbit repository, lets move on. I will cover that in a later discussion. Now go ahead and edit the index.html and shutdown and restart Tomcat. What you should observe is that the change you had made is retained and that Brix has restored your changes. So let's see what happened on the back-end.\n\nWithin brix-demo, when you fire up it creates a Jackrabbit repository and two workspaces (one called '**default**' and another with a UID - '**brix_ws_869e3fa0** ...') that's backed by a Java Derby database and this repository and workspace are persisted within Derby here \"C:\\Apps\\apache-tomcat-6.0.24\\temp\\brix.demo.repository\" defined by \"Using JCR repository url\" comment. And as long as this folder remains within the reach of Brix when you startup, your changes and content will be persistent across restarts.\n\nIf you go to that folder on your file system, you will find the following structure:\n\n[C:\\Apps\\apache-tomcat-6.0.24\\temp\\brix.demo.repository]\n|   **repository.xml**\n|\n+---repository\n|   +---index\n|   +---meta\n|   +---namespaces\n|   \\---nodetypes\n+---version\n|   \\---db\n\\---**workspaces**\n+---**brix_ws_869e3fa0_e06c_48dd_a66f_4b0f251c42d0**\n|       **workspace.xml**\n|\n\\---**default**\n**workspace.xml**\n\nAnd in particular if you examine the \"repository.xml\" file, you will begin to see a pattern beginning to evolve. This file will be the key in setting up and configuring our Jackrabbit repository. In our next discussion, we will begin by examining the parts that make up Jackrabbit repository and how we can move the repository to a H2 database. This should give us a better understanding on how one would move the repository to a database like \"MySQL\" or \"Oracle\" or \"SQL Server\". And in the third installment of this discussion, we will look at clustering the applications such that we have two instances of Brix-cms talking to a centralized H2 database and how modifying a content on one instance is reflected in the other instance.\n",

This is a good start for Java.\n\nNow the next question one would ask is - what happens when you want to pass a list of arguments of different types.

The file's can usually be reduced by 1/8th the original deflated jar file.\n\nSo when the browser requests the server for that JAR file, in the request header it will send all the formats that it can accept, namely -\n\nAccept-Encoding=pack200-gzip, gzip\n\nThis tells the server that if you have a pack200-gzip then send that but in the case you do not, then send me the gzip-ed version of the JAR file.\n\nSo the next step in making this magic trick work is to modify the ARCHIVE tag to a servlet instead of a resource request. So now your ARCHIVE tag looks like this:\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ARCHIVE = \"/archive/MyJARServlet.do?file=MyAppletArchive.jar\"\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in your MyJARServlet, you can scan on the file-system first for a\"MyAppletArchive.pack.jar.gz\" file and send it and in the case that the request does not have a Accept_Encoding of \"pack200-gzip\" then your code can default to sending in the plain-old \"gzip\" JAR file.\n\nTo see a sample of how this work, see the following URL:\n[http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/deployment/deployment-guide/pack200.html](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/deployment/deployment-guide/pack200.html)\n\nNow the next question one would ask is \"How do I pack it using Pack200 format?\"\n\nSimple, within the JRE/bin or JDK/bin directory of Java 5 or later, you will find a utility called \"pack200.exe\" (windows). You can take an existing JAR file and pack it into that format by using the following command:\n\nJRE/bin>pack200 myjarfile.jar\n\nBy using this strategy, you can decrease the time it takes to send that file. Smaller file = less time to send and less bandwidth that's used.  If you plan on implementing this, bear in mind that there is a little bit of overhead to unpacking a Pack200 or compressed-gzip file as opposed to a JAR-ed non-compressed file. So you decide which approach makes sense.\n\nCheers.\n\n\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider signing up for my RSS feed or Email Newsletter. See links on the right side.\n",

        "content": "---\nauthor: vguhesan\ncategories:\n- Java\n- Programming\ncomments: true\ndate: 2010-04-06T20:15:53Z\nexcerpt: 'Java 6 Gems: Scripting Framework to support Rhino Javascript and Groovy\n  (natively)'\nlink: http://mythinkpond.com/2010/04/06/java-6-gems-scripting-framework-to-support-rhino-javascript-and-groovy-natively/\nslug: java-6-gems-scripting-framework-to-support-rhino-javascript-and-groovy-natively\ntitle: 'Java 6 Gems: Scripting Framework to support Rhino Javascript and Groovy (natively)'\nurl: /2010/04/06/java-6-gems-scripting-framework-to-support-rhino-javascript-and-groovy-natively/\nwordpress_id: 100\n---\n\n**What is it?** With Java 6 there is a new addition (package: javax.script) that allows you to work with scripting languages like Javascript (using Rhino) and Groovy. Although there is built in support for adding scripting engines like Groovy, PHP, Perl, etc - what's bundled in this release is Mozilla's Rhino Javascript Engine.\n\n**Why embed a scripting language?** Most scripting languages out there are dynamically typed. Meaning, your code does not need to know what type of value you will be storing in a particular field at compile time. So for example, using JavaScript as a scripting language, you can store \"John\" [var name = \"John\";] or the numerical value of five (5) [var name = 5;] in a var. And since the variables are loosely typed, the language takes care of storing the data by guessing at what's being stored in that variable. Well why does this benefit us? Well, these technologies help us in prototyping quick, build applications faster, and for situations where you can execute commands repeatedly as well as in tying different technologies together. Developers usually agree that for processing\\parsing, Perl has always had an upper hand. So imaging using the perl scripting engine to develop an application that can parse a file efficiently. The other situation where embedding a scripting language comes in handy is - when you are developing a Java FX or Java Swing based application. Now you can develop libraries that can work seamlessly whether they are deployed on a FireFox browser or on a custom Java application on your smart-phone. The third arena where this makes sense is in server-side processing. Imaging a back-end application that needs to perform some text manipulation. You can tie a perl or sed or awk script engine on the back-end via a command shell like bash or ksh to perform the operations right within the Java application and all along work with variables right in the Java memory space.\n\n**Simple Example**: Let's take a look at an example, where we print the string \"Hello World\" onto the System.out.\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\n\nScriptEngineManager mgr = new ScriptEngineManager();\nScriptEngine jsEngine = mgr.getEngineByExtension(\"js\");\ntry {\njsEngine.eval(\"print('Hello, world!')\");\n} catch (ScriptException ex) {\nex.printStackTrace();\n}\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nWell, your first thought will be that I could have done this in one Java line [ System.out.println(\"Hello World\"); ] but the point here to see the profound impact that this option can bring to the Java language.\n\nNow let's look at a way to access a variable in the Java space:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\n\nString name = \"John\";\n\nScriptEngineManager mgr = new ScriptEngineManager();\n\nScriptEngine jsEngine = mgr.getEngineByExtension(\"js\");\n\ntry {\n\njsEngine.put(\"jsname\", name);\n\njsEngine.eval(\"print('My name is ' + jsname)\");\n\n} catch (ScriptException ex) {\n\nex.printStackTrace();\n\n}\n[/sourcecode]\n\nWell you can learn to use this technology with relevant examples [here](http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/scripting/). Interested in learning more about this technology and how it impacts Java, then look at [JSR 223](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/index.html). Now almost every web developer using Java has at one point of time explored [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/). In the past, you would run your Groovy code using an interpreter available when you download Groovy. But now using this technology, you can embed Groovy into the JVM such that you have access to data and variables in both namespaces. To cover the basis for using Groovy natively is beyond today's blog but you can see the possibilities of what you can do [here](http://groovy.codehaus.org/JSR+223+Scripting+with+Groovy).\n\nHere is a list of [available Scripting Engines](https://scripting.dev.java.net/) that you can drop into Java including support for Awk, Freemarker, Groovy, Javascript (using Rhino), Python, Ruby, Tcl, PHP, Smalltalk, etc. As I'm writing this blog, the **jsr223-engines.zip **contains the following scripting languages:\n\nbrowserjs, ejs, freemarker, groovy, jacl, jaskell, java, javascript, jawk, jelly, jep, jexl, jruby, jst, judo, juel, jython, ognl, pnuts, scheme, velocity, xpath, xslt.\n\nSo if you need to prototype fast and don't want to run an separate instance of Apache server with mod_php or mod_python to develop using these scripting languages. Now you can do this all within Tomcat or in native Java with a few simple drop-in JAR's.\n\nHappy Scripting!!!\n\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider signing up for my RSS feed or Email Newsletter.

        "content": "---\nauthor: vguhesan\ncategories:\n- ASP.NET\n- Programming\ncomments: true\ndate: 2010-04-08T18:07:06Z\nexcerpt: Finding the balance for your open source skills with .NET\nlink: http://mythinkpond.com/2010/04/08/finding-the-balance-for-your-open-source-skills-with-net/\nslug: finding-the-balance-for-your-open-source-skills-with-net\ntitle: Finding the balance for your open source skills with .NET\nurl: /2010/04/08/finding-the-balance-for-your-open-source-skills-with-net/\nwordpress_id: 105\n---\n\nI have been a strong supporter of Open Source technologies including Java, Python, Scala, Ruby and Perl for many, many years. But in order to be a strong Enterprise Architect, it's best to also understand the various other technologies (some proprietary) to gain a broader-balanced view of technology and whats out there. And in this ever changing world of technology - knowing the various options you have can make the difference between being nimble and creative to an implementation that bites the dust. So today let's explore some options you have with learning and getting on board with the .NET technology.\n\nThe first and foremost option that comes to everyone's mind is to buy (or download the 90-day trial version) of Microsoft Visual Studio. But did you know that there are some other \"free\" options that are available to get you started?\n\nYes, I said - \"free\" and Microsoft in the same paragraph. Surprisingly, in order to compete with all the open source options available out there, especially with Java, PHP, Ruby, etc, Microsoft is giving away their base development products for free. They are called Express Editions. Well, before we look at the options of Express Editions, let's take a short trip on what exactly is .NET.\n\nWith the introduction of the \".NET\" framework, Microsoft has gotten on the Java wagon (where a compiled byte code runs on a Java Runtime Engine instead of running natively as an executable). And in Microsoft's case the compiled code runs on a \"Common Language Runtime\" layer (CLR). So with this advantage, now a Microsoft developer can develop code in their favorite language of their choice - C++.NET (pronounced C-plus-plus), C#.NET (pronounced C-sharp), or VB.NET (Visual Basic) or Silverlight or ASP.NET (using the Visual Web Developer) and have the compiled code run in the CLR layer regardless of the source. This makes your development language agnostic. Write code in the language that you are most comfortable with and run it on the .NET platform. But now you need a common set of API's to drive this .NET engine. And hence the \"unified programming classes and API's\". By creating a common set of API's across all programming languages, the common language run-time enables cross-language inheritance, error handling, and debugging. But keep in mind that this allows you to run your code where the .NET run-time platform is available. And at present, Microsoft has only made this framework available on Windows and Windows compatible operating systems. Which means - no Linux.\n\nBut help is on the way with an open source project called [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com). The folks at Mono have implemented the run-time engine and .NET specification for other platforms and as I write this, there is support for this run-time in Linux and other OS's (Mono runs on Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, BSD, and Sun Solaris, Nintendo Wii, Sony PlayStation 3, Apple iPhone. - taken from Mono's project site). But what this means is that you need to use Mono's API instead of the \"unified programming classes and API's\". So depending on your goal, it may be better to use the Mono API instead of Microsoft's API. And also if you plan on using Mono, then make sure you are thinking in C# (c sharp) because that's the language that's currently supported.\n\nNow that we have a good understanding of our options, let's look at tools we can use, depending on the language you decide to learn:\n\n[Visual Basic 2008 Express  Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2008-Visual-Basic)\n\n[Visual C# 2008 Express Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2008-Visual-CS)\n\n[Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2008-Visual-CPP)\n\n[Visual Web Developer  2008 Express                 Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2008-Visual-Web-Developer)\n\nAnd when you install the first three, you also get the option to install SQL Server lite version as well. And if you are developing for SilverLight, you want to use the Visual Web Developer Express Edition.\n\nTo begin your learning in the .NET technology, one of the sites I have always found very helpful is [RampUp from Microsoft](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/rampup/default.aspx). Below is a link to the RampUp website:\n\nRampUp : [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/rampup/default.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/rampup/default.aspx)\n\nSo if .NET is your flavor of the month or if you are trying to learn a new language, give .NET a try.  You may find greener pastures on the other side.\n\n;-)\n\nCheers.\n\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider signing up for my RSS feed or Email Newsletter.

Namely, the splash screen.\n\nWhen you load up a native application, it's very traditional to display a \"splash screen\" with the company logo and branding of the particular product. In the past, you had to write your own loader class that did this. But now Java has added support for it. Class - [java.awt.SplashScreen](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/SplashScreen.html) does the job for you.\n\n\nThe splash screen is displayed as an   undecorated window containing an image. You can use GIF, JPEG, and PNG  files  for the image. Animation (for GIF) and transparency (for GIF, PNG) are  supported. The window is positioned at the center of the screen (the  position on multi-monitor systems is not specified - it is platform and    implementation dependent).  The window is closed automatically as soon as the first window is  displayed by  Swing/AWT\n\n\n- excerpt from the Java SplashScreen API\n\nThere are two ways to invoke the splash screen:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\n\njava -splash:filename.png MyApplication\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nor add it within your manifest.mf file like this\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\n\nManifest-Version: 1.0\nMain-Class: Test\nSplashScreen-Image: filename.png\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nNow you have a common, concise way to display the splash screen. And if your application does anything like reloading classes or has a built in feature to restart certain parts of the application. You can even get the latest from a remote URL. Since it exposes, the following API [ setImageURL(URL imageURL) ], you can programatically invoke a URL like this on the server-side:\n\nhttp://www.myapplication.com/getVersion.jsp?ver=1.2.3\n\nAnd this can return a binary stream of \"content-type: image/png\". But on the back-end you can tally the number of folks using version 1.2.3, etc. \n\nCheers.\n\n\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider signing up for my RSS feed or Email Newsletter.

Someone must have made a change to the base template such that they had removed the [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter) code that needs to be appended to the header. I've opened an issue in their jira issue tracker.\n\n>>>>>>>> Contents of JIRA Issue >>>>>>>>\nIt started happening today. When I visit the website, for example:\nhttp://jackrabbit.apache.org/node-type-notation.html\n\nAll the artifacts that contain a \"SCRIPT\" of type syntaxhighlighter does not get displayed.\n\nSo basically all examples on the site fails to show up.\n\nExample:\nUpon view-source, you will find artifacts like this:\n\n\n// \n\n\nNone of the artifacts that are using \"syntaxhighlighter\" gets displayed. Which leaves the site almost useless when it comes to documentation.\n\nProblem must have started today (April 19, 2010) since I was able to see them last night.\n>>>>>>>> Contents of JIRA Issue  >>>>>>>>\n\nBut while I wait for a fix the site is pretty much unusable. Let me show you an example,\n\n\n[![](http://mythinkpond.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/jackrabbit-issue.jpg)](http://mythinkpond.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/jackrabbit-issue.jpg)\n\n\nSo essentially you have a website that has no examples, no configuration details, etc. While I wait for a fix (which can happen any day), I thought this is a good opportunity to whip out a Greasemonkey Script to fix the issue. So this article focuses on creating a GreaseMonkey script that addresses this issue in my browser while the site is broken.\n\nLet's first look at the problem:\n\nApache Jackrabbit site needs to include the following in their header tag:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntaxHighlighter.config.bloggerMode = true;\nSyntaxHighlighter.config.clipboardSwf = 'http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/current/scripts/clipboard.swf';\nSyntaxHighlighter.all();\n\n\n\nUsing GreaseMonkey, you can insert any script at any point in the document or site (from the browsers perspective). So here's the script that does that:\n\n\n\n// ==UserScript==\n// @name           Apache JackRabbit Script\n// @namespace      jackrabbit.apache.org\n// @description    fixes the SyntaxHighlighter\n// @include        http://jackrabbit.apache.org/*\n// ==/UserScript==\n\nfunction addHeaderForSyntaxHighlighter(){\n\n\tvar addStyle1 = document.createElement('style');\n\taddStyle1.type = 'text/css';\n\taddStyle1.link = 'http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/current/styles/shCore.css';\n\n\tvar addStyle2 = document.createElement('style');\n\taddStyle2.type = 'text/css';\n\taddStyle2.link = 'http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/current/styles/shThemeDefault.css';\n\n\tvar addScript1 = document.createElement('script');\n\taddScript1.type = 'text/javascript';\n\taddScript1.src = 'http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/current/scripts/shCore.js';\n\n\tvar addScript2 = document.createElement('script');\n\taddScript2.type = 'text/javascript';\n\taddScript2.src = 'http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/current/scripts/shBrushJava.js';\n\n\tvar addScript3 = document.createElement('script');\n\taddScript3.type = 'text/javascript';\n\taddScript3.src = 'http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/current/scripts/shBrushXml.js';\n\n\tvar addBaseScript = document.createElement('script');\n\taddBaseScript.type = 'text/javascript';\n\taddBaseScript.src = 'http://www.avedatech.com/js/fixForJackRabbitSyntaxHighlighter.js';\n\n\tvar headID = document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0];\n\theadID.appendChild(addStyle1);\n\theadID.appendChild(addStyle2);\n\theadID.appendChild(addScript1);\n\theadID.appendChild(addScript2);\n\theadID.appendChild(addScript3);\n\theadID.appendChild(addBaseScript);\n\n}\n\naddHeaderForSyntaxHighlighter();\n\n\n\nThe above greesemonkey script adds the styles and necessary javascript to the page so that all the artifacts that use the SyntaxHighlighter are displayed. I'm attaching the file here for anyone who wants to use it in their greesemonkey script in FireFox.\n\n[Greesemonkey JackRabbit Site Fix Script](http://www.avedatech.com/js/apache_jackrabbit_script.user.js)\n\nIf you have GreeseMonkey installed in your FireFox browser, you can then click on the above link and GreeseMonkey will prompt you to approve the installation of the script. So you don't need to do anything fancy. And you can uninstall it at anytime.\n\n\n\n\n> \n> ### PS: If you are someone (or if you know of someone) who manages the Apache JackRabbit website, please fix the SyntaxHighlighter issue. We need the documentation! Thank You.\n> \n> \n\n\n\nCheers.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nUPDATE from Sébastien Launay on Thurs., April 22, 2010 - Thank you for the information. Helps to know that someone out there is aware of the issue.\n\n\nHi Venkatt,\n\nThanks for reporting this issue.\n\nThe bug appears to be global to Apache projects websites and related\nto the confluence auto-export feature:\n[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-2638](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-2638)\n\n--\nSébastien Launay\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nUpdate - on Friday, April 23rd, 2010 - this bug has been resolved and verified.

I've setup a server that streams live 24x7 latest tamil music.\n\n[After posting it I've had comments about some usability issues by using the default MP3 player in Nexus One. So I'm revising the steps.]\n\n1. Under Android Market Place, search for an application \"A Online Radio\". This app or others supports streaming from an Icecast2 server. Install it.\nhttp://aor.leadapps.com/****\n\n**![AOR QR Code](http://aor.leadapps.com/sites/default/files/aorQRcode.png)**\n\n2. Add the following URL into the application.\n\nLatest Tamil: http://music.iniyatamil.com:8000/MudhalMalai\nOld Sivaji (Classical) Songs: http://music.iniyatamil.com:8000/endrumsivaji\n\n3. It should begin streaming.\n\nIf you have a VLC Media player (or any streaming compatible player) you can point to this stream as well.\n\nIf you run into any issues, send me a note via this blog and I'll get it working. Also if you know of others who speak Tamil that might enjoy this stream, pass it along.\n\nEnjoy\n",

We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less.  We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less  time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less  judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less  wellness.\n\nWe drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too  little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too  tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.\n\nWe  have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too  much, love too seldom, and hate too often.\n\nWe've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added  years to life not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and  back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We  conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but  not better things.\n\nWe've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the  atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan  more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We  build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies  than ever, but we communicate less and less.\n\nThese are the times of fast foods and slow  digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow  relationships. These are the days of two incomes  but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway  morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do  everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is  much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when  technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose  either to share this insight, or to just hit delete...\n\n**Remember; spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not  going to be around forever.**\n\n**Remember, say a kind word to someone  who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow  up and leave your side.**\n\n**Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is  the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a  cent.**\n\n**Remember, to say, 'I love you' to your partner and your  loved ones, but most of all mean it. An embrace  will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of  you.**\n\n**Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that  person will not be there again.**\n\n**Give time to love, give time to  speak! And give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.**\n\n**AND  ALWAYS REMEMBER:**\n\n**Life is not measured by the number of  breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.\n**\n--  (supposedly written by George Carlin but cannot confirm)\n",

Before you do this, make sure you are NOT doing this in a production environment. By doing this in a real-production environment, you may be compromising the security of  your production infrastructure. Also backup all files before modifying them so that if you run into any errors, you can revert back.\n\n1. In startWeblogic.cmd file (located here: \\user_projects\\domains\\\\bin\\) there will a line that says the following:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\nset SAVE_JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS%\n[/sourcecode]\n\nedit that line and add the following \"-Dweblogic.management.allowClearTextPasswords=true\". Please note that in your case you may have additional java options pre-defined for your environment. Here's the end result:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\nset SAVE_JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -Dweblogic.management.allowClearTextPasswords=true\n [/sourcecode]\n\n2. Next in each of your jdbc files (located here: \\user_projects\\domains\\\\config\\jdbc), remove the following tag:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\n...\n[/sourcecode]\n\nand replace the password with a JDBC property called \"password\" with the clear-text password like this:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\n\n \n user\n testuser\n \n \n password\n mypasswordfortest\n \n \n[/sourcecode]\n\n3. Start up your server and you should be good to go.\n\nAlso as an added bonus, you can also bypass Weblogic from asking for your weblogic userid and password by adding the below two lines to your startWeblogic.cmd file (right after the line in step #1 above).\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\nset WLS_USER=your_weblogic_id\nset WLS_PW=your_weblogic_password\n[/sourcecode]\n\nCheers\n",

And I've always wondered about the settings in Twitter, especially one particular setting - \"public vs private\".\n\nLet me first review the setting. If you set your privacy settings to \"private\", then all posts after that time-line will only be available to the followers that you have allowed. And if at some point of time, you decide to toggle it to \"public\", then all posts (even the ones you sent in the past - as private) becomes open to the public. So all the gory details you have shared with your \"private followers\" is now shared with the rest of the world. There is no \"in-between\". So basically either all's out there or all's private.\n\nIs my notion of how this works correct?\n\nAssuming my understanding is what's described above, what I feel is that life in general is not necessary - black or white, public or private, yin or yang - there are a whole lot of shades of Grey (gray - for the folks in the good ol' USA - why? - don't know but that's for another discussion.) in between. So if you are with me so far and share the same thoughts then we are on the same page.\n\nNow being in the technology arena, I don't want to be the one who always points out the problem but with no solution. So here's a proposed solution. I would love to hear your thoughts and comments on this.\n\n\n\n\t\n  * You log into Twitter (or this other tool), and you see tabs at top -  . Now before you jump and say \"we don't  need private\", hear me out.\n\n\t\n  * Based on the tab you have selected, what you post under that tab is  governed by rules defined there. So what you post under \"public\" is out  for the world to see. What you post under \"shared\" is shared with folks  that are following you. And what you have \"posted\" (back to this later),  under \"private\" - is only displayed to you.\n\n\t\n  * In my world, I would like to see further divisions of which group of  followers gets to see which set of posts. But that's for another day.\n\n\nIn that way, you can post your messages and still not worry about who's seeing what. You are probably thinking, \"dude, isn't that what Facebook does today\". Well my answer to that is yes, but I do like the Twitter - 140 character limit. This limit opens up a world of possibilities. Devices that can now support it where it wasn't possible before.\n\nHere are some examples of everyday situations where I think those options makes sense:\n\n\t\n  1. You are at work and you want to share a link to a not-so clean joke or a  picture with a few of your coworkers. They are all twitter users and  you have them added as \"followers-coworkers\". Then by selecting your  \"Shared\" tab and adding in your link, and choosing -  \"Followers-coworkers\" from the drop down, I know only the folks in the  \"co-worker\" group sees the link.\n\n\t\n  2. You had your son or daughters, birthday party and you want to share the  link to some pictures (via twitter), imaging if you could once again, go  to \"Shared\" and choose \"followers-family+friends\" and now all the folks  who are part of your \"family\" and \"friends\" gets the link.\n\n\t\n  3. You find out Walmart across the nation is giving away a free TV to the  first one thousand people tomorrow, and you are dying to share it with  the world. Then you can go to the \"Public\" tab and post the message (and  you better run to the store now and camp out there. Knowing everyone on  Twitter is going be standing in line waiting for that free tv).\n\n\nAnd now for the \"Private\" tab.\n\n\t\n  1. Sarah has something private (say a provocative picture of her) that she  wants to share with her boyfriend Joe. She goes to her \"private\" tab and  send a link to the pic, and chooses \"Joe\" from the link. Now Joe (and  only Joe) gets the message. Not the rest of the world. Although (in my  version), when someone chooses the \"private\" or \"shared\" tab, then by  default all communication between the the user and the server are via  SSL (HTTPS), preventing any eavesdropping or sniffing - to make it very  private.\n\n\t\n  2. Rachel works as a network engineer for Cisco. She wants her monitoring  applications to notify her when one of her servers goes offline. She has  utilized the \"open API\" model of Twitter and has written a little code  utilizing it such that when one of her server goes offline, it sends a  notification - via Twitter to her Twitter profile - \"rachel%private\".  Now using her smart-phone, she gets notified so this becomes the Web 2.0  platform for SMS - opening up a world of possibilities.\n\n\nSo I hope I've made my case on why there is room for some enhancements to how Twitter works today. I would love to hear your thoughts and comments on this.\n\nCheers.\n",

The problem happens when you try to use Spring configuration for your database. In my case, I was using Spring to update data back to a H2 database.\n\nWell, here's one way to deal with this issue. Disable the \"Google App Engine\". Yes, based on my research, if you're using  GWT, you can disable Google App Engine and still continue your development with GWT.\n\nYou can right click on your project and go into properties. Under [Google] -> [App Engine], you can \"uncheck\" - use Google App Engine. And rebuild the application and resume your debugging.\n\nThis allows you to use Spring beans to persist your data in a database.\n\nCheers.\n",

But before we explore the answer, I should warn you that this approach is going away from what Maven would like you to do. In Maven, you can take each of your jars\\libraries and add them to your local repository and then include them as needed in your projects. If you want to go the proper route [here's how](http://maven.apache.org/general.html#importing-jars) you do it. This keeps a consistent version in all your projects and can allow you to gracefully update the library as new versions become available.\n\nBut if you still want to go ahead and add these custom jars in your project then follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\t\n  1. Create a \"lib\" folder under your project like this: \"\\src\\main\\webapp\\WEB-INF\\lib\"\n\n\t\n  2. Copy needed \"jars\" etc that you want included inside your WAR bundle folder.\n\n\t\n  3. Invoke your maven build as you normally do. I use \"mvn install\", which creates builds the war file.\n\n\nIf you examine the WAR file, your jars that you included in step-1 and step-2 will be there.\n\nBy the way, have you tried Vaadin lately? To summarize my experience with Vaddin... \"It's a breath of fresh air. Simple. Elegant. Concise.\"\n\nCheers.\n",

(Also see my other blog from today for the issue that started this journey).\n\nHere are my specifications:\n\n**Development Machine**\n\n\n\n\t\n  * Windows-7, 64-bit\n\n\t\n  * java version \"1.6.0_24\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_24-b07)\nJava HotSpot(TM) **64-Bit Server VM** (build 19.1-b02, mixed mode)\n\n\t\n  * Grails 1.4.0.M1\n\n\t\n  * Tomcat - apache-tomcat64-6.0.32\n\n\n**Local Deployment Server**\n\n\n\n\t\n  * Windows Vista, 32-bit\n\n\t\n  * java version \"1.6.0_26\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_26-b03)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 20.1-b02, mixed mode, sharing)\n\n\t\n  * Grails (does not matter since I'll be deploying a WAR)\n\n\t\n  * Tomcat - apache-tomcat-6.0.32 (32-bit version of Tomcat)\n\n\nSince the issue we are taking about deals with Grails, let's get into he details of how I ended up with the WAR. In Grails, I issued the following command:\n\n    \n    >grails war abcdefg.war\n\n\nThis creates a war file. When deployed under the 64-bit Tomcat, no issues. But when deployed under the 32-bit Tomcat. I was getting the\n\nJul 1, 2011 10:08:25 AM org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext start\nSEVERE: Error listenerStart\n\n(See my [previous article](http://mythinkpond.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/tomcat-6-infamous-severe-error-listenerstart-message-how-to-debug-this-error/) on how I enabled debugging to get to the root cause of the issue.)\n\nBut after some debugging, what it boiled down to was a \"Class Cannot Be Found\" error:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\n\n\nJul 1, 2011 11:29:25 AM org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext listenerStart\nSEVERE: Error configuring application listener of class org.codehaus.groovy.grails.web.util.Log4jConfigListener\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.codehaus.groovy.grails.web.util.Log4jConfigListener\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nIn examining the war file, the JAR file named \"grails-web-1.4.0.M1.jar\" under the \"/WEB-INF/lib\" does not contain the needed \"Log4jConfigListener\" class under \"grails-web-1.4.0.M1.jar\\org\\codehaus\\groovy\\grails\\web\\util\\\"\n\nBut clearly this class is inside this other JAR file named \"grails-plugin-logging-1.4.0.M1.jar\" under \"\\org\\codehaus\\groovy\\grails\\web\\util\\\".\n\nAnd this identical war file works under the 64-bit Tomcat but not under the 32-bit Tomcat.\n\nSo how did I resolve the issue? I upgraded my 32-bit box to Tomcat 7.0 and this made it work. But clearly, there is an underlying issue with the class-loader under the 32-bit Tomcat 6.0.32.\n\nMaybe someone reading this will have the answer to this issue.\n\nCheers!\n",

And in trying to see the extended logging on what that \"listenerStart\" error means. After some lucky searches, you will see links asking you to drop a \"log4j.properties\" file under '/WEB-INF/classes' directory inside your WAR to help debug which one of the listeners is throwing this crazy error.\n\nWell, this advise will most likely work for you if you are developing under an earlier version of Tomcat. If you are using versions 6.0 or above then continue to read on...\n\nIn Tomcat 6 or above, the default logger is the\"java.util.logging\" logger and not Log4J. So if you are trying to add a \"log4j.properties\" file - **this will NOT work**. The Java utils logger looks for a file called \"logging.properties\" as stated here:\n[http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/logging.html](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/logging.html)\n\nSo to get to the debugging details create a \"logging.properties\" file under your\"/WEB-INF/classes\" folder of your WAR and you're all set.\n\nAnd now when you restart your Tomcat, you will see all of your debugging in it's full glory!!!\n\nSample **logging.properties** file:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\norg.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].level = INFO\norg.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nand you will most likely see a \"class-not-found\" exception. ;-)\n\nLook at the bright side, you're now one step closer to the solution.\n\nHappy coding!\n",

PMD from [http://pmd.sourceforge.net/](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/)**\n_License:_ PMD is licensed under a \"BSD-style\" license\n\nPMD scans Java source code and looks for potential problems like:\n\n* Possible bugs - empty try/catch/finally/switch statements\n* Dead code - unused local variables, parameters and private methods\n* Suboptimal code - wasteful String/StringBuffer usage\n* Overcomplicated expressions - unnecessary if statements, for loops that could be while loops\n* Duplicate code - copied/pasted code means copied/pasted bugs\n\nYou can download everything from here, and you can get an overview of all the rules at the rulesets index page.\n\nPMD is integrated with JDeveloper, Eclipse, JEdit, JBuilder, BlueJ, CodeGuide, NetBeans/Sun Java Studio Enterprise/Creator, IntelliJ IDEA, TextPad, Maven, Ant, Gel, JCreator, and Emacs.\n\n**2. FindBug from [http://findbugs.sourceforge.net](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net)**\n_License:_ L-GPL\n\nFindBugs, a program which uses static analysis to look for bugs in Java code. And since this is a project from my alumni university (IEEE - University of Maryland, College Park - Bill Pugh) , I have to definitely add this contribution to this list.\n\n**3. Clover from [http://www.cenqua.com/clover/](http://www.cenqua.com/clover/)**\n_License:_ Free for Open Source (more like a GPL)\n\nMeasures statement, method, and branch coverage and has XML, HTML, and GUI reporting. and comprehensive plug-ins for major IDEs.\n\n* Improve Test Quality\n* Increase Testing Productivity\n* Keep Team on Track\n\nFully integrated plugins for NetBeans, Eclipse , IntelliJ IDEA, JBuilder and JDeveloper. These plugins allow you to measure and inspect coverage results without leaving the IDE.\nSeamless Integration with projects using Apache Ant and Maven. * Easy integration into legacy build systems with command line interface and API.\nFast, accurate, configurable, detailed coverage reporting of Method, Statement, and Branch coverage.\nRich reporting in HTML, PDF, XML or a Swing GUI\nPrecise control over the coverage gathering with source-level filtering.\nHistorical charting of code coverage and other metrics.\nFully compatible with JUnit 3.x & 4.x, TestNG, JTiger and other testing frameworks. Can also be used with manual, functional or integration testing.\n\n**4. Macker from [http://innig.net/macker/](http://innig.net/macker/)**\n_License:_ GPL\n\nMacker is a build-time architectural rule checking utility for Java developers. It's meant to model the architectural ideals programmers always dream up for their projects, and then break -- it helps keep code clean and consistent. You can tailor a rules file to suit a specific project's structure, or write some general \"good practice\" rules for your code. Macker doesn't try to shove anybody else's rules down your throat; it's flexible, and writing a rules file is part of the development process for each unique project.\n\n**5 EMMA from [http://emma.sourceforge.net/](http://emma.sourceforge.net/)**\n_License:_ EMMA is distributed under the terms of Common Public License v1.0 and is thus free for both open-source and commercial development.\n\nReports on class, method, basic block, and line coverage (text, HTML, and XML).\n\nEMMA can instrument classes for coverage either offline (before they are loaded) or on the fly (using an instrumenting application classloader).\n\nSupported coverage types: class, method, line, basic block. EMMA can detect when a single source code line is covered only partially.\n\nCoverage stats are aggregated at method, class, package, and \"all classes\" levels.\n\nOutput report types: plain text, HTML, XML. All report types support drill-down, to a user-controlled detail depth. The HTML report supports source code linking.\n\nOutput reports can highlight items with coverage levels below user-provided thresholds.\n\nCoverage data obtained in different instrumentation or test runs can be merged together.\n\nEMMA does not require access to the source code and degrades gracefully with decreasing amount of debug information available in the input classes.\n\nEMMA can instrument individial .class files or entire .jars (in place, if desired). Efficient coverage subset filtering is possible, too.\n\nMakefile and ANT build integration are supported on equal footing.\n\nEMMA is quite fast: the runtime overhead of added instrumentation is small (5-20%) and the bytecode instrumentor itself is very fast (mostly limited by file I/O speed). Memory overhead is a few hundred bytes per Java class.\n\nEMMA is 100% pure Java, has no external library dependencies, and works in any Java 2 JVM (even 1.2.x).\n\n**6. XRadar from [http://xradar.sourceforge.net/](http://xradar.sourceforge.net/)**\n_License:_ BSD (me thinks)\n\nThe XRadar is an open extensible code report tool currently supporting all Java based systems. The batch-processing framework produces HTML/SVG reports of the systems current state and the development over time - all presented in sexy tables and graphs.\n\nThe XRadar gives measurements on standard software metrics such as package metrics and dependencies, code size and complexity, code duplications, coding violations and code-style violations.\n\n**7. Hammurapi from Hammurapi Group**\n_License:_ (if anyone knows the license for this email me Venkatt.Guhesan at Y! dot com)\n\nHammurapi is a tool for execution of automated inspection of Java program code. Following the example of 282 rules of Hammurabi's code, we are offered over 120 Java classes, the so-called inspectors, which can, at three levels (source code, packages, repository of Java files), state whether the analysed source code contains violations of commonly accepted standards of coding.\n\nRelevant Links:\nhttp://en.sdjournal.org/products/articleInfo/93\nhttp://wiki.hammurapi.biz/index.php?title=Hammurapi_4_Quick_Start\n\n**8.

I'm using Grails 1.4.M1 and it bundles with it H2 database version [H2 1.2.147 (2010-11-21)]\n\nIf you decide to run H2 in a server mode, you would most likely download the latest version of H2 Database from the website. As of writing this article, the stable version of H2 is [H2 1.3.158 (2011-07-17)].\n\n**Issue:** If you run your Grails application using 1.2.147 and your external H2 database happens to be 1.3.158, then the SELECT's work fine but when you run INSERT or UPDATE statements, they are not committed.\n\nWhen I switched the H2 version to 1.2.147, then the .save() worked fine.\n\n\n",

The development moves at a rapid rate but when you decide to include libraries that depend on other libraries, your pain starts to build up. For example, when you include the module \"HttpBuilder\"in your project you may run into issues with Xerces and xml-apis, especially when you attempt to deploy the WAR file under Tomcat. These libraries are included as part of Tomcat and so an older version of those classes may give you a heartburn.\n\nIf your objective is to use some raw HTTP classes to create your requests and responses, then you can use the basic URL class to do most of the raw connection options. Although using HttpBuilder makes it a clean implementation, the URL class gives you very similar power without all the overhead of including the dependency classes.\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\n\ndef urlConnect = new URL(url)\ndef connection = urlConnect.openConnection()\n//Set all of your needed headers\nconnection.setRequestProperty(\"X-Forwarded-For\", \"\")\n\nif(connection.responseCode == 200){\nresponseText = connection.content.text\n}\nelse{\nprintln \"An error occurred:\"\nprintln connection.responseCode\nprintln connection.responseMessage\n}\n[/sourcecode]\n\nSo the trick to the Groovy URL class is to use the \"openConnection()\" method and then gain access to some of the raw functionality.\n\nCheers.\n",

Both solutions do not have a graceful way to do copy to clipboard especially if you do not have flash enabled or installed for your platform - browser.\n\nAs the browser matures, maybe this functionality might be allowed natively from a Javascript code but until then, the ZeroClipboard and zClip are the best ways to implement a \"copy-to-clipboard\".\n\n\n",

I discovered that a few dependent packages are required before you try upgrading to Python 2.7.\n\n[sourcecode]\n\nyum -y groupinstall 'Development Tools'\nyum -y install openssl-devel* ncurses-devel* zlib*.x86_64\nyum -y install bzip2 bzip2-devel bzip2-libs\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nNext download the latest tar/gzip/tgz available here:\n[http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7/](http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7/)\n\n[sourcecode]\n\n#Download the latest available at this time\ncurl -O http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7/Python-2.7.tgz\n#Unzip/expand file\ntar xfz Python-2.7.tgz\n#Change Directory to the unzipped folder\ncd Python-2.7\n#read README file or you can follow the lines below\n./configure\n#you could also run configure with threads and shared enabled\n#./configure --prefix=/opt/python2.7 --with-threads --enable-shared\n#Compile\nmake\n#Install\nmake install\n# Exit from your shell and open a new shell/SSH session\n# Use the command below to display which path of python is currently active\nwhich python\n#To verify if the install succeeded\npython -V\n#Use UPPERCASE 'V' - not lower-case.\n#Output will be \"Python 2.7\"\n#Sometimes you may need to exit out of your shell\n#and them come back in to see the version changes.\n#So best exit your current shell prompt and reopen\n#a new before checking the version.\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nYou're all set. You've just upgraded to Python 2.7.\n\nThe next logical step that you need to perform is to install the setup tools that allows you to install modules. (Please note that setuptools is not available for Python 3.0+, instead use Distrubute available here - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute)\n\nDownload the latest setuptools for your version of Python (2.7 in this case) from here:\nhttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#downloads\n\n[sourcecode]\n\ncurl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg\n\nchmod 775 setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg\n\nsh setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg\n\n#This should install the egg here: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nNext you want to install \"PIP\", this enables the download and install of modules in Python:\n\n[sourcecode]\n$ curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-1.0.tar.gz\n$ tar xvfz pip-1.0.tar.gz\n$ cd pip-1.0\n$ python setup.py install # may need to be root\n[/sourcecode]\n\nNow you're all set. Suppose you wanted to install a module called 'simplejson'.\n\nYou can now do this using command syntax like this:\n\n    \n    pip install simplejson\n\n\nCheers.\n",

And then run \"make\" again.\n\nThis time you should see no errors. The last step is to run \"make install\" and you're all set.\n\n\n\n\nNow don't forget to edit your main config and add\n    LoadModule python_module /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/mod_python.so\nand if your configuration uses ClearModuleList, then also\n    AddModule mod_python.c\n\n\n\n\nNext, Configure mod_python to work with Apache\n\nEdit your httpd.conf (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf), add:\n\n[sourcecode]\n\nLoadModule python_module /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/mod_python.so\n\n#Under the AddHandler section\n\n\n    AddHandler mod_python .py\n    PythonHandler myscript\n    PythonDebug On\n\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nTo learn what the \"AddHandler\" does go here:\nhttp://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-3.2.8/doc-html/tut-what-it-do.html\n\nStop and Start Apache HTTPD (/etc/init.d/httpd restart)\n\nYou're all set.\n\nTo verify, create a file in your DocumentRoot (/var/www/html)\n\n\n[sourcecode]\n#!/usr/bin/python\nfrom mod_python import apache\n\ndef handler(req):\n\n    req.content_type = \"text/plain\"\n    req.write(\"Hello World from Apache HTTPD!\")\n\n    return apache.OK\n[/sourcecode]\n\nAs a last step, goto http://:/abc.py\n\nYou should see, \"Hello World from Apache HTTPD!\". Notice that I didn't goto \"myscript.py\". And I have pointed to \"myscript\" in the AddHandler parameter. This \"myscript.py\" acts like the Controller in a MVC framework. So if you were installing an application like Django... then Django will act as the gatekeeper passing requests back and forth.\n\nTo learn more about the handler, go here:\nhttp://www.modpython.org/live/current/doc-html/inst-testing.html\n\nor here's an excerpt from that site:\n\n\n\nNote that according to the configuration written above, you can also point your browser to any URL ending in .py in the test directory. You can for example point your browser to /test/foobar.py and it will be handled by mptest.py. That's because you explicitely set the handler to always be mptest, whatever the requested file was. If you want to have many handler files named handler1.py, handler2.py and so on, and have them accessible on /test/handler1.py, /test/handler2.py, etc., then you have to use a higher level handler system such as the mod_python publisher (see 3.1), mpservlets or Vampire. Those are just special mod_python handler that know how to map requests to a dynamically loaded handler. \n\n\n\n\nAfter writing this blog, I noticed that some users may prefer a PHP like feel. This can be done by adding a \"Publisher Handler\" (PSP).\n\nEdit your httpd.conf (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf), add:\n\n[sourcecode]\n\nLoadModule python_module /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/mod_python.so\n\n#Change AddHandler to the following\n\n\n   AddHandler mod_python .psp .psp_\n   PythonHandler mod_python.psp\n   PythonDebug On\n\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nStop and start httpd (/etc/init.d/httpd restart).\n\nNow create a file \"test.psp\" under DocumentRoot (/var/www/html)\n\n[sourcecode]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nWhen you visit http://:/test.psp\n\nYou should see \"Today is ---\" message.\n\nYou can learn more about the PSP handler here:\nhttp://webpython.codepoint.net/mod_python_tutorial\n\n\nCheers!\n\n",

In looking at the \"[StaticResources](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/)\" link that's part of the Django documentation, it's a bit cryptic for someone who's starting out in Django and Python. So here's a step-by-step on two ways to configure your static-resources in a Django project.\n\nThis method is described in the Django documentation and is probably the preferred approach.\n\n1. Edit \"settings.py\" under your Django project and define the following variables:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\nSTATIC_ROOT = ''\nSTATIC_URL = '/s/'\nSTATICFILES_DIRS = (\n    'C://Projects//mydjangoproject//static//',\n)\n[/sourcecode]\n\n2. Edit \"urls.py\" and add the following:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\nfrom spog import settings\n...\nif settings.DEBUG:\n    urlpatterns += patterns('',\n        (r'^s/(?P.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve',\n           {'document_root': settings.STATIC_ROOT}),\n    )\n[/sourcecode]\n\nNotice the extra comma at the end. That's very important!\n\n3. Edit your html file, in this example index.html\n\n[sourcecode language=\"html\"]\n\n\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\n4. Copy your resources to \"C:\\Projects\\mydjangoproject\\static\\css\\grid960.css\".\n\n5. python manage.py runserver 8080\n\n6. Open browser and visit \"http://localhost:8080/[YOUR_PAGE]\".\n\nIf you notice the step-2 syntax, it is wrapped inside a \"if settings.DEBUG\" if-block. This variable will be false when you deploy to a production environment where you may have something like an Apache Web server serving all your static resources. So when you move to production, you can push all your static resources to be outside the project.\n\n",

You can read more about the new exciting features [here](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/whatsnew/).\n\nBut as I started to tinker with the \"remote interpreter\" feature - I stumbled upon some challenges and I thought I'd document them for other PyCharm users who might benefit from this blog entry.\n\nLet's get right into the issue:\n\n\n## My Setup:\n\n\nI have a Windows 7 host where I do most of my development. I develop software for a Linux based system and most of the Python libraries that I need to work from third-party vendors are only available for Linux. And so my PyCharm IDE runs on Windows and I have a VirtualBox instance of CentOS linux running within my host machine accessible via a Virtual Box - Bridged Adapter. This Linux could also be running in a separate  physical host accessible via TCP-IP. Now that we have a good idea about my development environment, let's go over why I want to use the \"remote interpreters\" feature.\n\n\n## Remote Interpreters\n\n\nThis feature allows you to connect with a Python environment and all's of it's SITE_PACKAGES available on the remote machine as if you were running it locally on your native PC. Furthermore, you can perform step-through of your code right from your development platform as if you ran the IDE right within the Linux machine. (Please note that this feature can then lend itself to running the Linux server as a terminal without a GUI/Windows Manager like KDE/Gnome). This will simplify your footprint on the server side.\n\n\n## Challenges\n\n\nWhen you run the interpreter, you will run into issues such as \"No such file or directory.\" That's because when you execute a file natively in Windows under c:\\temp\\abc.py - the \"remote interpreter\" is now looking for a file under that same path in the remote server under Linux. To avoid this issue, here's the solution I have engaged.\n\n\n\n\t\n  1. Share my c:\\projects\\MyProject to myself so that I can map a new drive under Windows such as \"K:\\MyProjects\".\n\n\t\n  2. Shared a \"Machine Folder\" to my Virtual machine. If you have a remote host, then either setup a GIT push scheme or a SFTP from your Windows to this remote server. See image below for illustration.\n[![Virtual Box - Machine Target](/img/2012/04/ri-screen4.png)](/img/2012/04/ri-screen4.png)\n\n\t\n  3. At this time, My \"c:\\projects\" folder is shared to the Linux environment as \"/media/sf_K_DRIVE/\" and \"auto-mounted\". (I have also added my user-id to the \"vboxsf\" group because of permissions. But that's another blog...)\n\n\t\n  4. Now every modification of my Python files in my \"K:\\MyProject\", is exactly the same on the Linux virtual-box.\n\n\t\n  5. The first setting to change is the \"Line Seperator\" (unless you want to execute Dos2Unix each time you run the file on Linux). This can be done under \"Code Style\" in PyCharm Settings. See image below:[![PyCharm Settings Line Seperator](/img/2012/04/ri-screen1.png)](/img/2012/04/ri-screen1.png)\n\n\t\n  6. Next, configure the \"Remote Python Interpreter\". See screenshot below:[![PyCharm - Configure Remote Interpreter](/img/2012/04/ri-screen2.png)](/img/2012/04/ri-screen2.png)\n\n\t\n  7. In the previous step, when you choose a path on the Linux server for the \"PyCharm helpers\", PyCharm pushes via SSH a set of libraries and software that helps with the remote debugging and scaffolding.\n\n\t\n  8. The next step is to Run (or Debug) your code. See the screenshot below that shows the details of the \"Run/Debug Configuration\" screen. The important parts are \"Working Directory\" and \"Path Mappings\". This is the trick that allows you to map your Windows Path to an equivalent Linux Path.[![PyCharm - Run/Debug Configuration Screen](/img/2012/04/ri-screen3c.png)](/img/2012/04/ri-screen3c.png)\n\n\t\n  9. Now run (or debug) away your code as if it was running locally on your native Windows development platform.\n\n\nThat should get the job done.\n\nUpdate on May 18th, 2012\n\n#This shows you an example of how you would invoke a Python UnitTest via remote-interpreter to another script located in the same folder.\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\n\n#Invoked from sendfoo_test.py\nscriptName = \"sendfoo.py\"\n# BASE_PATH is the absolute path of ../.. relative to this script location\nBASE_PATH = reduce(lambda l,r: l + os.path.sep + r, os.path.dirname( os.path.realpath( __file__ ) ).split( os.path.sep ) )\n#print BASE_PATH\n# add ../../scripts (relative to the file (!) and not to the CWD)\nNEWSCRIPTPATH = os.path.join( BASE_PATH, scriptName )\n#print NEWSCRIPTPATH\n\n#Further down in code…\np1 = os.popen(\"%s\" % self.NEWSCRIPTPATH, \"w\")\np1.close()\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nFor early Pythons...\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\n\n#If you are using Python 2.6.6 (not Python 2.7+)\nscriptLocation = \"sendfoo.py\"\nscriptLocation = os.path.join( os.path.dirname( os.path.realpath( __file__ ) ), scriptLocation )\nprint scriptLocation\n\n#Further down in code…\np1 = os.popen(\"%s\" % self.NEWSCRIPTPATH, \"w\")\np1.close()\n\n[/sourcecode]\n",

In simple terms, you will see a lot of &quot; and if you use a Mac OSx system, your will see - &ldquo; and &rdquo; displayed as content in your blog pages.\n\nWell here's a way to correct them.\n\n1. Identify a list of these escaped XML entities using the [HTML Entities Table](http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/special.html). For most folks it would be just &quot;\n\n2. Within your hosting environment, find out how to get to a MySQL query window to run your SQL commands.\n\n3. Backup your current database. And know how to restore it. (I am not liable).\n\n4. Run the following SQL command:\n\n[sourcecode]\n\nUPDATE wp_posts\nSET post_content= REPLACE(post_content, '&quot;', '\"');\nUPDATE wp_posts\nSET post_content=REPLACE(post_content, '&lt;', '');\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\nHere in this example, I'm replacing all occurrences of &amp;quot; with a double-quote. Now load up a sample blog article and verify that the issue is resolved.\n\nRepeat steps-4 for each escaped HTML entity.\n\nNow you're all set to begin blogging with your newly imported WordPress blog.

This has been done for quite some time. So either a feature graduates from the Mozilla academy (which means that they no longer have the prefix of \"Moz\") or they may get removed in future releases. This has been the case for WebSockets.\n\nSo how do we test for both WebSockets and MozWebSocket? Here's how:\n\n[sourcecode]\n\nvar wssupport = \"MozWebSocket\" in window ? 'MozWebSocket' : (\"WebSocket\" in window ? 'WebSocket' : null);\n\nfunction WebSocketTest()\n{\n  if (support == null)\n  {\n     alert(\"Browser supports websocket\");\n  }\n  else\n  {\n     alert(\"Browser does not support websocket\");\n  }\n}\n\n//To create a websocket using this strategy use the following:\nvar ws = new window[wssupport](\"wss://your-domain/path\");\n//Use \"wss://\" for secure-sockets or use \"ws://\" for plain-sockets w/o encryption.\n...\n[Run WebSocket test](WebSocketTest()\")\n[/sourcecode]\n\nThe variable \"wssupport\" contains an elaborate nested-if-else statement. It first checks for \"MozWebSocket\", if found, then returns  \"MozWebSocket\" as a string. Else it tests for \"WebSocket\", if found returns \"WebSocket\" as a string else returns \"null\".\n\nHere is a useful URL for determining Browser Support for Web Sockets:[\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets#Browser_compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets#Browser_compatibility)\n\nIf you have found this article useful, consider subscribing to my posts and/or share them.\n",

Here's a quick and easy way.\n\nSuppose your mount point you want to perform this IO is \"/myspecialmount\". (Assuming you have plenty of space to test)\n\nThen the easiest way to load some IO is through the following bash-script:\n\n[sourcecode language=\"bash\"]\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile true\ndo\n  echo \"=== Starting clean-up ====\"\n  rm -fr /myspecialmount/usr\n  echo \"=== Starting load ====\"\n  rsync -avp /usr /myspecialmount\ndone\n[/sourcecode]\n\nIn the above code sample, Line-6 - cleans up the filesystem sub-folder \"/myspecialmount/usr\". The options \"-fr\" allows you to perform the clean-up recursively with a force option. And in Line-8, we synchronize the systems \"/usr\" folder and files onto \"/myspecialmount/usr\". And these two steps are done on an infinite-loop.\n\nPlease note that this is not a true load-testing where you have parallel-simultaneous IO requests being sent to a filesystem but rather a simple way to create some load.\n\nThere are some specialized tools such as \"[iozone](http://www.iozone.org/)\", \"[bonnie](http://www.coker.com.au/bonnie++/)\" and \"[dbench](http://www.samba.org/ftp/tridge/dbench/)\" and [others](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/tooltable.php) (see Filesystems section) that are sophisticated bench-marking tools available to the Linux community.\n\nIf you find this article useful, please subscribe to my blog and/or share my link with others.\n",

If you are not familiar with this, I would suggest you look at the following link:\n\n[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - Event-driven I/O server-side _JavaScript_ environment based on V8.\n\nIf you are a Java developer and as you try out the examples, you will notice how this will be a great addition into your infrastructure. But then as you delve deeper, you may notice some of the short comings such as having to support another full stack of package manager (Node uses [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) as it's package manager) and it has it's own deployment, unit testing, etc. to support. And then the thought might occur that - what-if I had the same infrastructure available natively in the Java stack??? Would that not solve a lot of the logistical challenges? If your answer is \"yes\", then you should look at this library...\n\n[VertX](http://vertx.io/) from [vert.io](http://vertx.io/) - Effortless asynchronous application development for the modern web and enterprise\n\nThe VertX solution is built upon (and requires) a JDK/JRE under the skin. But then because Java support other languages under it's skin, you can leverage the benefits of languages such as - JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Ruby, Python, Groovy or Java.\n\nAccording to the VertX website - it says and I quote \"Write your application components in **JavaScript**, **CoffeeScript**, **Ruby**, **Python**, **Groovy** or **Java**. Or mix and match several programming languages in a single app.\"\n\nHere's their \"Hello-World\":\n\n[sourcecode language=\"JavaScript\"]\nload('vertx.js')\n\nvertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(function(req) {\n    var file = req.path === '/' ? 'index.html' : req.path;\n    req.response.sendFile('webroot/' + file);\n}).listen(8080)\n[/sourcecode]\n\nAs always, you need to evaluate this option to see if this solution fits in your infrastructure and it's pros and cons.\n\nIf you find this article useful, share this with others and/or subscribe to this blog.\n",

I'm documenting those challenges so that if someone else runs into the same pitfalls I did, they can avoid it.\n\nIn this example today, we will work with the first \"HelloWorld\" examples in the ZeroMQ guide found [here](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Ask-and-Ye-Shall-Receive). I added a few modifications to the sample such as a package name and a try-catch around the Thread and an exception.tostring() to display any stack-trace.\n\nSource code for src/zmq/hwserver.java\n\n[sourcecode language=\"java\"]\n\npackage zmq;\n\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.io.StringWriter;\n\nimport org.zeromq.ZMQ;\n\n//\n// Hello World server in Java\n// Binds REP socket to tcp://*:5555\n// Expects \"Hello\" from client, replies with \"World\"\n//\n\npublic class hwserver {\n\n\t/**\n\t * @param args\n\t */\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\tZMQ.Context context = ZMQ.context(1);\n\t\t// Socket to talk to clients\n\t\tZMQ.Socket socket = context.socket(ZMQ.REP);\n\t\tsocket.bind (\"tcp://*:5555\");\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\twhile (!Thread.currentThread ().isInterrupted ()) {\n\t\t\t\tbyte[] reply = socket.recv(0);\n\t\t\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Received Hello\");\n\t\t\t\tString request = \"World\" ;\n\t\t\t\tsocket.send(request.getBytes (), 0);\n\t\t\t\tThread.sleep(1000); // Do some 'work'\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} catch(Exception e) {\n\t\t\tStringWriter sw = new StringWriter();\n\t\t\tPrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(sw);\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace(pw);\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(sw.toString());\n\t\t}\n\t\tsocket.close();\n\t\tcontext.term();\n\n\t}\n\n}\n[/sourcecode]\n\nSimilarly, source code for the client, src/zmq/hwclient.java\n\n[sourcecode language=\"java\"]\npackage zmq;\n\nimport org.zeromq.ZMQ;\n\npublic class hwclient {\n\n\t/**\n\t * @param args\n\t */\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\tZMQ.Context context = ZMQ.context(1);\n\n\t\t// Socket to talk to server\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Connecting to hello world server\");\n\n\t\tZMQ.Socket socket = context.socket(ZMQ.REQ);\n\t\tsocket.connect (\"tcp://localhost:5555\");\n\n\t\tfor(int requestNbr = 0; requestNbr != 10; requestNbr++) {\n\t\t\tString request = \"Hello\" ;\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Sending Hello \" + requestNbr );\n\t\t\tsocket.send(request.getBytes (), 0);\n\n\t\t\tbyte[] reply = socket.recv(0);\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Received \" + new String (reply) + \" \" + requestNbr);\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tsocket.close();\n\t\tcontext.term();\n\n\t}\n\n}\n[/sourcecode]\n\nNow that you have the sample code, how do you compile using the ZeroMQ?\n\n**Assumption:** You have installed Java (1.7 or above)\n\n**Step-1: Installing ZeroMQ onto CentOS [Following steps are performed under root account]\n**\n\n\n\n\t\n  1. Install \"Development Tools\" if it's not already installed on your CentOS as root:       _ yum groupinstall \"Development Tools\"_\n\n\t\n  2. Download the \"[POSIX tarball](http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-3.2.3.tar.gz)\"  ZeroMQ source code onto your CentOS development machine from [here](http://www.zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software). At the time of writing this article, ZeroMQ version 3.2.3 was the stable release. You might want to download the latest stable release.\n\n\t\n  3. Unpack the .tar.gz source archive.\n\n\t\n  4. Run ./configure, followed by \"make\" then \"make install\".\n\n\t\n  5. Run ldconfig after installation.\n\n\n**Step-2: Installing a Language Binding for Java. In this case, we will use JZMQ from**[ **https://github.com/zeromq/jzmq**](https://github.com/zeromq/jzmq)\n\n\n\n\t\n  1. Download the latest stable release from GITHub link above. (git clone git://github.com/zeromq/jzmq.git)\n\n\t\n  2. Change directory, cd jzmq\n\n\t\n  3. Compile and Install:[sourcecode language=\"java\"]\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake\nmake install\n[/sourcecode]\n\n\t\n  4. Where did it install?\n[sourcecode language=\"java\"]\n# JAR is located here: /usr/local/share/java/zmq.jar\n# .so link files are located here: /usr/local/lib\n[/sourcecode]\n\n\t\n  5. Important Step: Add /usr/local/lib to a line in /etc/ld.so.conf (here is my copy after editing)\n[sourcecode language=\"java\"]\ninclude ld.so.conf.d/*.conf\n/usr/local/lib\n[/sourcecode]\n\n\t\n  6. Reload \"ldconfig\". This clears the cache.\n\n\n\n\n**Step-3: Compile and run the Java examples above.**\n\n[sourcecode language=\"java\"]\ncd ~/dev/zeromq/example/\n# Compile hwserver.java\njavac -classpath  /usr/local/share/java/zmq.jar ./zmq/hwserver.java\n# Compile hwclient.java\njavac -classpath  /usr/local/share/java/zmq.jar ./zmq/hwclient.java\n# Run hwserver in a separate prompt\njava -classpath .: /usr/local/share/java/zmq.jar -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib zmq.hwserver\n# Run hwclient in a seperate prompt\njava -classpath .:/usr/local/share/java/zmq.jar -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib zmq.hwclient\n[/sourcecode]\n\n**Output on the hwserver console:**\n\n[sourcecode language=\"java\"]\nReceived Hello\nReceived Hello\nReceived Hello\nReceived Hello\nReceived Hello\nReceived Hello\nReceived Hello\nReceived Hello\nReceived Hello\nReceived Hello\n[/sourcecode]\n\n**output on the hwclient console:**\n\n[sourcecode language=\"java\"]\nConnecting to hello world server\nSending Hello 0\nReceived World 0\nSending Hello 1\nReceived World 1\nSending Hello 2\nReceived World 2\nSending Hello 3\nReceived World 3\nSending Hello 4\nReceived World 4\nSending Hello 5\nReceived World 5\nSending Hello 6\nReceived World 6\nSending Hello 7\nReceived World 7\nSending Hello 8\nReceived World 8\nSending Hello 9\nReceived World 9\n[/sourcecode]\n\nFew interesting points to note are as follows:\n\n\n\n\t\n  * What happens if you started the client first and then the server? Well, the client waits until the server becomes available (or in other words, until some process connects to socket port 5555) and then sends the message. When you say socket.send(...), ZeroMQ actually _enqueues_ a message to be sent later by a dedicated communication thread and this thread waits until a bind on port 5555 happens by \"server\".\n\n\t\n  * Also observe that the \"server\" is doing the connecting, and the \"client\" is doing the binding.\n\n\n\n\n### \n\n\n\n\n### What is ZeroMQ (ØMQ)?\n\n\n(Excerpt from the[ ZeroMQ website](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#-MQ-in-a-Hundred-Words)!)\n\nØMQ (also seen as ZeroMQ, 0MQ, zmq) looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry atomic messages across various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fanout, pub-sub, task distribution, and request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore applications, built as asynchronous message-processing tasks. It has a score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems. ØMQ is from [iMatix](http://www.imatix.com) and is LGPLv3 open source.\n\n_If you find this article useful, please subscribe to my blog and/or share my link with others._\n",

You want to remove any non-essential files that Grails can rebuild at run-time. And if you are using either GITHub or BitBucket for your GIT repo's the default .gitignore file created or provided by GITHub is setup for configured for a Grails 1.X project and not a Grails 2.X project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo here are a few simple steps to help you create the correct .gitignore file for a Grails 2.X project:\n\nStep-1: Create the following .gitignore file under the root Grails project folder:\n\n\n*.iws\n*Db.properties\n*Db.script\n.settings\n.classpath\n.project\n.idea\neclipse\nstacktrace.log\ntarget\ntarget-eclipse\n/plugins\n/web-app/plugins\n/web-app/WEB-INF/classes\nweb-app/WEB-INF/tld/c.tld\nweb-app/WEB-INF/tld/fmt.tld\n\n\nStep-2: Git does not allow you to check in empty (but essential folders). To avoid this you can run the following command:\n\n\nfind . -type d -empty -exec touch {}/.gitignore \\;\n\n\nThe above command creates a empty \".gitignore\" file below all folders. And since you now have non-empty folders, you can now check them in into Git so that if you check-out/clone the project in the future, you will have those essential but empty folders.\n\n\nIf you find this article useful, Tweet me on your Twitter account or +1 me on Google-Plus so that others can also benefit from this information.\n\n\nCheers\n",

Shows you the internals of\n  the circuit that makes this one attractive. '\nlink: http://mythinkpond.com/2014/09/28/philips-slimstyle-60w-led-bulb-teardown/\nslug: philips-slimstyle-60w-led-bulb-teardown\ntags:\n- AC-DC Circuits\n- AC2DC\n- Electronics\n- IC\n- LED Driver Circuit\n- Philips SlimStyle LED 60W bulb\n- teardown\ntitle: Philips SlimStyle 60W LED bulb teardown\nurl: /2014/09/29/philips-slimstyle-60w-led-bulb-teardown/\nwordpress_id: 724\n---\n\nWhile I was visiting Home Depot, I saw a Philips SlimStyle 60W LED bulb on clearance for two-dollars. I could not resist buying it for a tear-down to see how it's built. I always wondered how they convert the 120VAC to a regulated DC voltage with high-current feed for lighting up those LED's. So here is the first version of the tear-down showing you what's inside the bulb. I will blog more about the current and voltage at the LED junction on a subsequent blog.\n\nPicture of the bulb before the tear-down. You can see the unique flat shape.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-W4h2m6iNZ2w/VCiJFzWY4hI/AAAAAAAAMi4/OPq_kVVZusk/w354-h500-no/BulbImage.JPG)\n\nPackaging front\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Z0tee4l9A7k/VCiAAcYowII/AAAAAAAAMiY/udlEM3QHIxs/w474-h840-no/IMAG0531.jpg)\n\nPackaging back\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RFqLuIi37So/VCiADNOL7wI/AAAAAAAAMig/bwl-0J8rUZo/w474-h840-no/IMAG0532.jpg)\n\nWhat you expect to find is a custom version of what is called in Electrical Engineering as an [LED Driver Circuit](http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/drivers/led-driver.aspx) (and [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=LED+Driver+Circuit&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&channel=sb)). What makes this one interesting is how they made this all fit inside a tiny little base. And the flat design with the beveled plastic aids in efficient heat dissipation. So you don't see the big metal base you find in other LED bulb models.\n\nPlastic encasing removed (cut using a band-saw)\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mJ1iIlGAUfg/VCh9i8l9PdI/AAAAAAAAMeY/4dGic7TKHac/w1358-h766-no/IMAG0518.jpg)\n\nYou can see the LED's placed in a radial manner front and back. Although the placement allows you to distribute the light you still end up with a shadow effect. (I think the incandescent light was the perfect design)\n\nFront face of the PCB board which makes up the base of the bulb:\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BisX7VXgkGk/VCh9Cz1ANKI/AAAAAAAAMc4/gnycnaNfUfw/w1358-h766-no/IMAG0510.jpg)\n\nTransformer........... EE13302-162 B (KEE 1412) ([closest neighbor to this transformer](http://www.rhombus-ind.com/cats/magcat.pdf))\n\nBlack capacitor... S103\n\nOrange rectangular piece bottom left (with Westinghouse logo) is a standard ceramic-fuse.\n\nThe black (labeled-N)  and white wires (labeled-L) gets soldered to the bulb metallic base (120VAC inputs)\n\nBack of the PCB board:\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-UmOE4qLRfTA/VCh-8GjaYKI/AAAAAAAAMgE/aWFFskD4K2g/w1358-h766-no/IMAG0527.jpg)\n\nD1300 is a standard NPN transitor.\n\nMore to come in the next blogs.

This will make Graphene cost effective to use in the industry. To learn more about the details behind the process, see the links below:\n\nArticle, (from International Business Times)\n[Graphene Manufactured Using Tea Tree Extract Paving Way For Cheaper Method](http://www.ibtimes.com/graphene-manufactured-using-tea-tree-extract-paving-way-cheaper-method-study-2064355)\n\nThe science behind the process:\n[Catalyst-Free Plasma Enhanced Growth of Graphene from Sustainable Sources](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b01363)\n\n**[#2] Discovery:\nThe Nano Lightbulb**\n\nWhat problem does this solve?\nToday, we have hit an upper-limit on how much we can compact inside the silica-chip. As you may have seen, our computers now has \"quad-core\" processors which are directly due to the ability to pack more chips/processors per square-inch. But we are reaching an upper limit on this because of three major factors:\n\n1) Scale: We are already working at the atomic scale. Trying to compress more atoms smaller than the atoms in gold and copper etc will not be possible unless we find new materials that have a smaller atomic structure and has electrical conductive properties.\n2) Heat: Moving electrons in a copper wire produces heat as a side-effect. The smaller and more compact they are then you produce more heat and the very same heat also makes the gold, copper and metal atoms excited that they begin to show signs of expansion. And you know what happens when two copper wires with electricity comes together. You end with a short-circuit.\n\n3) Growing demand for alloys and metals: The world is reaching a near death of small-circuits because the mines that produce these alloys are getting depleted. So we will reach a end of rare-metals in the future (just like Oil). It's a limited resource on this planet!\n\nThe Solution:\nYoung Duck Kim while trying to clean up some graphene in the lab tried to clean it up in a novel manner. He wrapped up some graphene with a small wire and induced a current through the wire to aid in cleaning the dust on the graphene. What he observed is that the graphene - glowed (almost like a incandescent light bulb). What he noticed is that just like a lightbulb, you can turn the graphene on and off and you can turn it on and off as fast as 10 Gigahertz (possibly 100 GHz) - imagine turning a switch on and off a thousand-one-million times a sec (that's a lot). And it produces negligible heat dissipation and the graphene does not burn out. So imagine being able to produce a binary-switch (On | Off - 0|1) using this method of switching on a light-bulb at a microscopic level.\n\nAnd the story gets better, using fiber-optics (instead of copper and gold wires) you can build circuits at the microscopic level to move this on-off signal will revolutionize the industry to produce even smaller, denser circuits that moves data at the speed of light with almost zero (negligible) heat-dissipation! And to produce the fiber-optic cables and matrial - you need silica (which comes from sand on a beach - which we have plenty of on the planet)\n\n**NOW THAT'S REVOLUTIONARY!**\n\nNow humans can break the metal/electrical barrier to forge us into the \"AGE OF LIGHT\".\n\nYou can learn more about the discovery here:\nArticle on Popular Science: [The Nano Lightbulb](http://www.popsci.com/extreme-sports-scientist-who-shrinking-lightbulb-subatomic-scale)\n\n**What does this mean?**\n1) Reduce the need for rare-metals and alloys = less mining for the raw-materials = greener planet.\n2) Produce more complex devices that are smaller and produces less heat.\n3) Grow Graphene using greener methods = less harm to the environment\n4) High-Performance Computing (HPC) at a nano scale - computers that can process much-much more data in shorter time = better forecasting for things like weather, green-house effects, etc and more profits for businesses worldwide!!!\n\n**Greener Healthier Planet that's more Profitable than ever before!!!**\n\n**Welcome to the \"Age of Light\"!!!**\n\nIf you find this article important, please share it with others!\n",

I've spent a good two days to get the process ironed out. So I'm sharing this so that others can avoid the same pitfalls and can have a good head-start with setting up their environment.\n\n**Pitfall #1**: Develop for your platform. I'm accustomed to developing in Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTE but in this case my deployment environment happens to be CentOS 6.7 (minimal server). Because the dependencies such as GLIBC versions are different, it's best to stick to a setup with the target platform in mind.\n\nThis exercise assumes that you've installed CentOS 6.7 (minimal server option).\n\n**Pitfall #2**:\n\nIn your research you may have come across the following errors below. I'm including them in hopes that the search engine bots will bring you to this blog so that you can save some headaches.\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\nchecking whether the C compiler works… configure: error: in `/root/downloads/libzmq-master’:\nconfigure: error: cannot run C compiled programs.\nIf you meant to cross compile, use `–host’.\n[/sourcecode]\n\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\nlibsodium is not installed\n[/sourcecode]\n\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\nsrc/.libs/libzmq.so: undefined reference to `crypto_secretbox_open'\nsrc/.libs/libzmq.so: undefined reference to `crypto_box_beforenm'\nsrc/.libs/libzmq.so: undefined reference to `crypto_secretbox'\nsrc/.libs/libzmq.so: undefined reference to `crypto_box'\nsrc/.libs/libzmq.so: undefined reference to `crypto_box_keypair'\nsrc/.libs/libzmq.so: undefined reference to `sodium_init'\nsrc/.libs/libzmq.so: undefined reference to `crypto_box_open'\nsrc/.libs/libzmq.so: undefined reference to `randombytes_close'\nsrc/.libs/libzmq.so: undefined reference to `crypto_box_open_afternm'\nsrc/.libs/libzmq.so: undefined reference to `randombytes'\nsrc/.libs/libzmq.so: undefined reference to `crypto_box_afternm'\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake[1]: *** [tools/curve_keygen] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/root/downloads/libzmq-master'\nmake: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\n[/sourcecode]\n\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\nGLIB 2.14 not found\n[/sourcecode]\n\n\n\n## Solution:\n\n\nThe following steps provides you a step-by-step instruction to get you to a point where you can compile the standard ZeroMQ HelloWorld Server and HelloWorld Client.\n\n[sourcecode language=\"jscript\"]\n# Steps to a working ZeroMQ 4+ code on CentOS67\n\n# Login as root or make sure you have sudo access\n# The following instructions assume you are logged in as \"root\"\n# Assumes the following path /root/downloads\nmkdir download\ncd download\n\n# ZeroMQ 4+ requires libsodium \n# You also need a C compiler\n\n# Pre-requisites\nyum update\n# Gets your system upto date with the latest updates\n\nyum install libtool gcc-c++ glib*\n# This installs autoconf, automake, cloog-ppl, cpp, gcc, mpfr, ppl\nyum groupinstall \"development tools\"\n\n\n\n# Let us install and build libsodium\nwget https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.3.tar.gz\ntar -xvf libsodium-1.0.3.tar.gz\ncd libsodium-1.0.3\n./configure\nmake clean\nmake\nmake install\n# libsodium libraries are now installed under /usr/local/lib directory\n# Next we need to tell libzmq and other development code where to find these libraries\n\n# Add the following exports defining the following environmental libraries\n# Edit the root users .bashrc file\nvim /root/.bashrc\n# Add the following\n#-----\nexport sodium_CFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/include\"\nexport sodium_LIBS=\"-L/usr/local/lib\"\nexport CPATH=/usr/local/include\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib\nexport LD_RUN_PATH=/usr/local/lib\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig\nexport CFLAGS=$(pkg-config --cflags libsodium)\nexport LDFLAGS=$(pkg-config --libs libsodium)\n#-----\n\n# Reinitialize settings under .bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n# Add libsodium to ldconfig \necho '/usr/local/lib' > tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libsodium.conf\n\n# Download the latest lizmq from the GIT repository\ncd /root/downloads\nwget https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/archive/master.zip\nunzip master.zip\ncd libzmq-master\n\n# Lets begin building it\n# Generate the configure script from template\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake clean\nmake\nmake install\n\n# ZeroMQ libraries are installed in /usr/local/lib path\n# Need to add the libraries to ldconfig so that they can be\n# statically linked in C code\n# Since ZMQ is installed in the same path as libsodium,\n# we do not need to add another path into /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf\n# we just need to reload the \"ldconfig\"\nldconfig\n\n# Let try compiling and testing a sample code\nmkdir /root/downloads/zmqtest\ncd /root/downloads/zmqtest\n\n# vim helloserver.c\n# Copy hwserver code from the following url:\nwget https://github.com/imatix/zguide/raw/master/examples/C/hwserver.c\n\n# Copy hwclient code from the following url:\nwget https://github.com/imatix/zguide/raw/master/examples/C/hwclient.c\n\n# Compile hwserver \ngcc hwserver.c -o hwserver -lzmq\ngcc hwclient.c -o hwclient -lzmq\n\n# Open two SSH terminals to /root/downloads/zmqtest\n# Run hello-world server in terminal #1\n# Run hello-world client in terminal #2\n\n# If it runs, you're all set to go\n# Please link me from your blog/social places so that others can easily find this article\n# Also provide me with feedback so that I can ammend this guide for others\n\n[/sourcecode]\n\n# Thank you & cheers!\n\n\n\n\n",

Being close to technology is a blessing and a curse sometimes. You start seeing ways to improve the user experience in everything you touch and you feel compelled to make the world a better place. So \"yes\" - you've heard it. I am a member of Harry's Shave Club.\n\nI got tired of buying those expensive store brand razors that starts with a \"G\". So I've tried both the DollarShaveClub and Harry's. I've settled on Harry's Shave Club. But that's not the focus of this article. So today, as I was shaving this morning, it occurred to me that Harry's can improve their customer experience by adding new functionality to their site and so as soon as I got out of the shower, I dashed to my computer before the idea skipped my mind and sat down to write this email to Harry's. I'm hoping that they see the value in adding this functionality to their website. I'm furthering my request for this feature by blogging about it. So let's hope that it reaches someone's ear at Harry's and they see the value in my suggestion and they implement my request for helping Harry's customers with a better user-experience.\n\nSo here we go with the email:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo: help@harrys.com\nSubject: Suggestion on functionality that can enrich the Harry's experience\n\nHello:\n\nI am one of your current customers on a shave plan and also happened to be an Web\nEnterprise Architect. I wanted to provide feedback on one of the things I've noticed.\n\nComparing Harry's with other shave-clubs. You send more blades in one mail-order than\nothers. And it would be ideal if you had an option online where I can login into your\nsite and add an alert/reminder with a set frequency so that I get an email remainder\nto switch my razor-blade.\n\nFor example, if I setup a reminder email from Harry's to remind me to swap out my\nblades once every 10-days. On the 10th day, I get an email saying -\n\n\"This is a friendly reminder from Harry's that it's time to swap out your razor-blade\non your next shave.\n\nIf you wish to change the frequency or disable this reminder, you can do that under\nyour profile in Harry's. We at Harry's believe in making sure you have the best shave\neach and every day.\"\n\nThis way, when I see that email and the next day I am in the shower, I will swap out\nto a new blade. So today I keep using a blade until I actually see it becoming dull.\nAnd with your shipping frequency, after a few months I end up with boxes and boxes of\nrefills which I do not know what to do with and most likely, I will then be forced to\nstop shipment on new refills until I run out of them. But by using my above process,\nyou are helping each user swap out their blades on a regular \"habit-forming\" cycle and\nyou are making sure that your customers are not stopping/pausing the shipping cycle\nand most important of all, each of those emails can now have an added value for an\nopportunity for marketing.\n\nCheers\n\nVenkatt Guhesan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This flood is the worst seen in over 100 years in Chennai's history. The last time this happened, Chennai (ancient city called Madrasapatinam) was not as densely populated as today (although we do not have actual numbers because census data is not available from 100 years ago). And to make matters worse the rainy season has just begun. It is anticipated that the rains may continue for another month or so.\n\nThe gravity of the situation down in the city of Chennai can be understood by these two examples:\n\n\n\n\t\n  1. The Hindu, one of India's largest print newspaper has for the first time not published it's morning edition, since 1878. (Yes - 1878 - One Hundred and Thirty Seven years)\n\n\t\n  2. All flights to and from Chennai have been suspended. Only limited set of emergency fights for critical people. All other flights have been diverted.\n\n\nMy attempt at this blog is to record the event and to bring awareness to others so that we can all help in our own ways to improve the human condition suffered by people of the world. And unless we all unite and build a better tomorrow not only for us but our next generation, we the people that live among the wealthy nations of this world will suffer the same fate and demise as nature unravels it's fury. For the people of Chennai, India - the worst is yet to come as the after effects of flood such as increase in diseases from food borne viruses, lack of clean drinkable water, lack of clean sanitary conditions, lack of proper drainage systems to move the human waste.\n\nBelow are some pictures of today's condition as I write this:\n\n![ChennaiRains1](/img/2015/12/chennairains1.jpg)\n\n![ChennaiRains2](/img/2015/12/chennairains2.jpg)\n\nAnd for people who do not know where this is here is a map of India with the area that's being impacted.\n\n![ChennaiRains4](/img/2015/12/chennairains4.jpg)\n\n![ChennaiRains3](/img/2015/12/chennairains3.jpg?w=559)\n\n(pictures are not mine and I have taken these from the internet (and news) to share the story of the devastation suffered)\n\nHere are some links where you can read about the current situation and ways you can help support the cause (I am not affiliated with any):\n\n\n\n\t\n  * [Rescue Operations in Full Swing in Rain-Hit Chennai: Live Updates](http://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/tamil-nadu-batterred-by-rain-army-called-in-for-rescue-ops-live-updates-1249893)\n\n\t\n  * [Pictures, maps and charts that show just how bad the flood situation in Chennai is](http://scroll.in/article/769657/pictures-maps-and-charts-that-show-just-how-bad-the-flood-situation-in-chennai-is)\n\n\t\n  * [Chennai Rains: Here's How You Can Help](http://www.ndtv.com/chennai-news/chennai-floods-heres-how-you-can-help-1250640)\n\n\t\n  * [Google's Crisis Response on South India Flooding](http://google.org/crisisresponse/2015-chennai-flooding)\n\n\t\n  * [Emergency Helpline Numbers](http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/ChennaiRains-Here-Are-the-Emergency-Helpline-Numbers/2015/12/02/article3156826.ece)\n\n\t\n  * [Air Bridge To Aid Rescue Ops](http://www.ndtv.com/chennai-news/in-rain-hit-chennai-an-air-bridge-to-aid-rescue-ops-1250467)\n\n\t\n  * [Rain Stops, But Flood Waters Rising in Parts of Chennai.

Share the link to this and other articles on your Facebook, Twitter and other social media. As more people become aware of the problems facing humanity, the more government organizations will move towards supporting causes that makes an impact on humanity today. Right now the floods in Chennai are mentioned as a footnote in the daily news by the big news medias of the world.\n\n\t\n  2. Support organizations that are working towards making an impact such as the following:\n\n\t\n    * New Delhi Television (NDTV) has partnered with Fever 91.9 FM Chennai to coordinate relief and rescue efforts via phone, messages and on Twitter with the hashtag [#NDTVFeverFMChennai](https://twitter.com/search?vertical=default&q=%23NDTVFeverFMChennai). The SOS messages are being shared with relevant authorities.\n\n\t\n    * If you are a person in Chennai and you need a quick recharge on your phone (Airtel/Aircel/Vodaphone sites are down for recharge) for making emergency calls, [PayTM](https://paytm.com/blog/stay-safe-chennai/) (a local Chennai tele company) is offering a free recharge of Rs.30. Please call 1-800-103-0033 and they will recharge your phone free of cost so that you can make the needed emergency calls.\n\n\t\n    * [Google Crisis Website](http://google.org/crisisresponse/2015-chennai-flooding)\n\n\t\n    * Facebook, has activated its [Safety Check feature for the Chennai floods](http://www.facebook.com/safetycheck/chennaiflooding-dec2015/). The page helps people mark themselves or others as 'Safe' on the social network letting their friends and relatives know that they are alright.\n\n\t\n    * Twitter has also officially endorsed a list of hashtags that are being used for help and rescue during the crisis including #ChennaiRainsHelp #ChennaiVolunteer #ChennaiRescue.![twitter-chennai_650x488_61449141912](/img/2015/12/twitter-chennai_650x488_61449141912.jpg)\n\n\t\n    * Restaurant App Zomato (popularly known as Urbanspoon in the USA) has also launched and announced '[Meal for flood relief](http://zoma.to/chennairelief)' with which people can order free meals for flood victims.

When you consider donating during the holidays (and year-end), consider donating to organizations that help people in these areas that have a USA charter (for tax-deduction purposes). **_Please make sure you thoroughly research the charity before making a contribution. There are a lot of charitable scams going around._** Here are some I am familiar with:\n\n\t\n    * [Akshayapatra - Unlimited Food for Education](http://www.akshayapatra.org/)\n\n\t\n    * [Mother Teresa Charitable Trust](http://www.motherteresacharities.org/)\n\n\t\n    * [UNICEF Flood Relief Funds](https://www.unicefusa.org/mission/emergencies/floods)\n\n\t\n    * [Helping Hands (Uthavum Karangal)](http://www.udavumkarangal.org/)\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  4. Most big organizations such as Google, Amazon, Zappo, Facebook, IBM, US Federal Government, Microsoft (and many others I have not mentions because the list will go on and on) have donation programs that match dollar for dollar. Please consider nominating one of the charitable trust that can directly help with the flood victims.\n\n\t\n  5. Google & Amazon Drones: If you or someone you know at [Google](https://research.google.com/) or [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011) that's working on the drone project. Talk to the project team to see if you can use these drones to help identify people in crisis. You may be able to provide live feed to critical areas of impact while testing the prototypes. In my view this is the best place to test one of those drone projects to see how it can be leveraged to help humanity in crisis while getting some well needed PR. This will also benefit the companies because the air and FAA regulations will be nonexistent in this crisis situation in Chennai, India. _If you're someone from Google or Amazon Droid project, reading this, I am willing to volunteer my time to help with the logistics and in test driving your drones on the ground in Chennai while we help the folks up there. :-) _This is a great way Google & Amazon can make a positive impact to humanity while furthering science and technology!\n\n\t\n  6. Donate Portable Chargers: At this time, about 2 million people are without electricity to charge their cell-phones. Companies manufacturing portable battery chargers can help organize efforts to distributing USB portable charge units. This is beyond my capability but large companies can organize and mobilize this. Hopefully there is a reader out that who works for one of these companies that can make this happen.\n\n\t\n  7. To the Google's, Amazon's and Facebook's of the world: deploying portable mobile floating units for the following is essential:\n\n\t\n    1. Rescue emergency folks\n\n\t\n    2. Distribution of bottled water\n\n\t\n    3. Distribute food and medical supplies\n\n\t\n    4. Dysentery and antibiotics supplies\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  8. Long Term Global Needs:\n\n\t\n    1. Innovations in building portable, low-cost water filtration systems for drinking\n\n\t\n    2. Portable solar cells for charging bare essentials\n\n\t\n    3. Mobile-Floating Cell Towers for areas in crisis\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I have missed or if you come up with other means to help, send me an email and I will add the information on this page.\n\n\n## List of Emergency Contacts in Chennai and Surrounding Areas\n\n\n**Tree Fall, Water Logging:** 1913\n**Sewage Overflow:** 45674567,2200335\n**State Emergency:** 1070\n**District Emergency:**1077\n**Electricity:** 1912\n**Fire & Rescue: **101\n\n**Here are the regional office numbers:\nTiruvottiyur:** 9445190001\n**Manali:** 9445190002\n**Madhavaram:**9445190003\n**Tondiapret: **9445190004\n**Royapuram: **9445190005\n**Thiru.

If you visit the Revel site [here](https://revel.github.io/manual/organization.html), you will see their organization structure of a Revel project. In my case, their my_gocode/ folder is much deeper in what I store in my BitBucket account (or GitHub for that matter).\n\n    \n    .\n    ├── code\n    │   ├── bin\n    │   │   └── revel\n    │   ├── pkg\n    │   └── src\n    │       ├── github.com\n    ...\n    │       ├── golang.org\n    ...\n    │       ├── gopkg.in\n    ...\n    │       └── mywebsite.com\n    │           └── web\n    │               ├── app\n    │               │   ├── controllers\n    │               │   │   └── app.go\n    │               │   ├── init.go\n    │               │   └── views\n    │               │       ├── App\n    │               │       │   └── Index.html\n    │               │       ├── debug.html\n    │               │       ├── errors\n    │               │       │   ├── 404.html\n    │               │       │   └── 500.html\n    │               │       ├── flash.html\n    │               │       ├── footer.html\n    │               │       └── header.html\n    │               ├── conf\n    │               │   ├── app.conf\n    │               │   └── routes\n    │               ├── messages\n    │               │   └── sample.en\n    │               ├── public\n    │               │   ├── css\n    │               │   │   └── bootstrap.css\n    │               │   ├── img\n    │               │   │   ├── favicon.png\n    │               │   │   ├── glyphicons-halflings.png\n    │               │   │   └── glyphicons-halflings-white.png\n    │               │   └── js\n    │               │       └── jquery-1.9.1.min.js\n    │               ├── README.md\n    │               └── tests\n    │                   └── apptest.go\n    ├── design\n    │   ├── logo-design1.png\n    │   ├── logo-design1.psd\n    │   ├── logo-final.png\n    │   └── logo-design2.psd\n    ├── resources\n    │   └── some-materialcss-templates\n    ...\n    \n    \n\n\nAs you can see my structure also includes some PhotoShop artefacts that also needs to be stored in my BitBucket (GIT) project. In my case, I want to ignore some of the go lang artefacts and revel artefacts.\n\nSo in the project-root, I created a .gitignore with the following contents relative to my project-root:\n\n    \n    code/bin/\n    code/pkg/\n    code/src/github.com/\n    code/src/golang.org/\n    code/src/gopkg.in/\n    \n\n\nThe above tells GIT to ignore the \"github.com/**\", \"golang.org/**\" and \"gopkg.in/**\" subdirectories. As you add additional dependencies, you can revise and add to the above .gitignore file as needed.\n\nCheers!\n\n\n",

In their thirst for expansion, they colonized much of the known world.\n\nIn India, the Dutch, the Portuguese then the British all came under the name of colonization and expansion. They came in search of new trade-routes to the orient and as history has it, the interests of trade slowly turned into colonization and expansion of the empire.\n\nThe same has happened in Egypt, upper and lower Nile in Africa as well as the places on the border of the river Nile.\n\nToday's blog is not to question or critique the efforts and impact of the colonization had on the world but to look at how this **change** has brought the Egyptian, Nubian culture, history and archeology to the world stage. Contributions from archeologists like \"[Howard Carter [1874]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Carter)\" (English) and \"[Giovanni Battista Belzoni [1788]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Belzoni)\" (Italian) - would not have been possible if it wasn't for the need for the empires to expand. The expansion fueled projects and works to paint, document, map and collect artifacts to map out the history, culture and literature of the old world.\n\nIn India, you have translations of some old forgotten religious, cultural literature gems such as the [Thirukkural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirukku%E1%B9%9Ba%E1%B8%B7) and [Thiruvachagam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiruvacakam) (sacred utterance) translated by authors such as [G. U. Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Uglow_Pope). (1820's) have brought back timeless precious works that have disappeared. Similar, expeditions to Africa and Egypt has made new terms such as \"Egyptology\"  creep into the English language.\n\nHere is one such work:\n\n[![Narrative_Giovanni_Belzoni](/img/2016/03/narrative_giovanni_belzoni.png)](/img/2016/03/narrative_giovanni_belzoni.png)\n\nRecently, I came across an interesting e-copy of a narrative written by Giovanni Battista Belzoni titled \"Narrative of the Operations and Recent Discoveries Within the Pyramids, Temples, Tombs and Excavations in Egypt and Nubia\" (published in 1820). Reading through it you begin to see a circus-man (The Great Belzoni) turned Egyptian archeologist and in his efforts to bring artifacts such as the bust of Pharaoh Ramses to the museum in London. And how his sketches and paintings of upper Egypt (Cairo, pyramids) and lower Egypt (people of Nubia and Thebes) -must have awed and fascinated the English folks such that they pushed forward for more understanding of the Egyptian history and culture. Much of what we know of the Egyptian culture and history came from expeditions such as this.\n\nI would [highly recommend this book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Narrative_of_the_Operations_and_Recent_D.html?id=N38EAAAAYAAJ) to anyone looking for an adventure in time and place to an ancient world where two worlds collide. I had almost forgotten about the e-copy until I saw a [BBC documentary on Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_%28TV_series%29) on Egypt where the adventure of Belzoni was documented in a two part episode.\n\nNow on to the quote of the day. This quote is something that we can all ponder in light of the recent events in Brussels that has shook the world.\n\n\n\nAmerica will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.\n- **[Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln)**\n[American President that preserved the Union, abolished slavery in America and strengthened the federal government]\n\n\n\n\n.AUM.\n\n\n\n\n",

This is because of how a SSH session works! Each time you ssh into a server, it leverages a set of TTY screens to maintain an individual history for that session. So for example, the first ssh login (for the same userid) may get TTY session #1 and the second ssh login may get TTY session #2 and the server maintains individual session history. So unless, you end up on the same TTY ID the next day (or the next time you login), the commands you ran on the previous day will not appear on the \"history\" output.\n\nLinux & Bash (I said 'bash' for a reasons mentioned below) provides a very simple solution to merge your history so that all commands you (and many users logging in under the same ID like 'root') in all TTY sessions gets consolidated under one history. This is *rarely* known to Linux users but can come in very handy during investigations.\n\n\nThis is a great command to know especially when you're trying to investigate how files went missing on the server. Most likely, a user with 'root' permissions ran a \"rm (remove) * -Rf\" command not realizing they were removing files under a different directory such as /var or /usr/bin.\n\n\n\n\n# Run the following to merge\nhistory -a\n# Now if you type history, you will now see all of the commands you ran merged under one space\nhistory\n\n\n**WARNING**: The command may or may not work in your environment. To learn why, read on...\n\nPlease note that the \"history\" command is not a \"Linux\" command but rather a command offered by the respective shell such as \"BASH\". And that is why when you run \"man history\", you get all the commands provided by BASH. In most cases, BASH is the default preferred shell so when you SSH into a server you may end up in a BASH shell. But there are many others such as KORN, ASH, BSH, KSH, ZSH and so on. Each shell tries to overcome some kind of limitation. So depending upon the shell you're using some of the commands such as \"history -a\" may or may not work accurately. Consult your favorite shells' man pages to determine how to merge the history.\n\nCheers.\n\nToday, considering a comment made by my daughter, I thought I'd end all my blogs with a famous quote that inspires me in hopes that others that read my blog daily can also find inspiration and solace in their daily lives.\n\nNow for the quote that has moved me today:\n\n\nHistory will judge us by the difference we make in the everyday lives of children.\n- **[Nelson Mandela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela#Presidency_of_South_Africa:_1994.E2.80.9399)**\n[Freedom fighter, Anti-apartheid Revolutionary, President of South Africa]\n\n\n.AUM.\n",

At first, I considered doing my traditional option to leverage Wordpress (this blog MyThinkPond.com uses Wordpress). Then I thought of all the complexities of setting up a MySQL database, creating and registering the site with WP Jetpack, etc. I wanted something quick, easy to maintain and something that I can hand over to someone else for maintaining. Most software developers are used to GIT for source-control and if there was a way to keep the source files in a GIT then this opens up the possibility of merely giving thee end-user the access to the GIT repo and they can then either maintain it in the long run or branch it into their own copy. Spending a bit of time researching my options, I came across a suit of tools that allows you to generate [static-blogs and wiki](http://www.staticgen.com/). Out of the dozen or so options, I decided to explore the one with the most traffic (namely [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)) and one that is ranking fourth but built on GoLang (namely [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)).\n\nBoth Jekyll and Hugo had similar features when it came to Content, Front-Matter, Templates, Taxonomies, Themes, Categories, Sections, support for static content besides blogs, ability to support Markdown syntax for editing. So I would highly recommend both Jekyll and Hugo. What made me opt for Hugo is the simplicity of setup/installation. With Hugo, I had to download one executable [since it was developed in GoLang (one of my *new* favorite languages), it allows for native compilation for many different architectures and operating systems including Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OS X (Darwin) for x64, i386 and ARM architectures (essentially wherever the Go compiler tool chain can run). Once I unzipped the executable to a directory, all I had to do is to add it onto my $PATH either in Linux or in Windows. And that is all you need to do to get started. Whereas with Jekyll, I had to first install Ruby, then  Ruby Gems, then (gem install jekyll) then NodeJS and optionally Python 2.7 for Jekyll 2 or earlier. The installation steps for getting Jekyll was way too complex. Granted I had most of those tools already installed but for non-developers, this would be a pain-point.\n\nOnce Hugo was available on my $path, then to create a blank site all I had to do is as follows:\n\n\nmkdir myproject\ncd myproject\nhugo new site sivavishnu .\n# Creates a blank starter site with default theme\n\n\nNow in my case, I am a big fan of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). So I googled for a themes built on Bootstrap for Hugo. I came across a few options, which led me to [BootsWatch](https://bootswatch.com/). I found that Nicholas Whittier had created a Hugo-Bootswatch (Thank you Nicholas) theme built on top of Bootswatch&gt;Bootstrap. So to integrate Hugo-Bootswatch to my site, I followed directions on Hugo as follows:\n\n\ncd myproject\nmkdir themes\ngit clone https://github.com/nilproductions/hugo-bootswatch.git\n# This clones a copy of the \"hugo-bootswatch\" project under my \"themes\" folder\n\n\nNow to create some sample blog articles using Hugo:\n\n\ncd myproject\nhugo new post/first.md\n# This creates a markdown file under myproject/sivavishnu/content/post/first.md\n# You can now edit this file and using Markdown syntax for the headers and HTML for the body\n\n\nHere is a link to [learning Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)\n\nNow here are two options in Hugo to preview and to generate the site:\n\n\n# To run a webserver with latest blog (including drafts):\nhugo --theme=hugo-bootswatch server --buildDrafts\n# To generate the latest blog (under public folder)\nhugo --theme=hugo-bootswatch\n\n\nIf you want to then go crazy and create static pages, exclusions from list, customize the CSS by adding some colors, etc you can do\nall of this! :-)\n\nBut here are two options that you will need to consider:\n\n\n\n\t\n  1. Since this is a static site (with no back-end server engine like PHP, NodeJS, Tomcat, etc), you will need a way to allow users to search your site. I chose to add [Google Site Search](https://cse.google.com/cse/all) as an option. It's free but the catch is that until Google indexes your site the search option is not functional.\n\n\t\n  2. Analytics for your site to trach your hits. See the [link in Hugo document](https://gohugo.io/extras/analytics/) for steps.\n\n\t\n  3. Adding the ability under blog pages for external users to comment. Again Hugo gives you the option to integrate with [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). See link on Hugo document [how-to integrate Hugo with Disqus](https://gohugo.io/extras/comments/).\n\n\nThis way, all your site is doing is serve a static site. Did I mention that Hugo also generates your static site wicked fast?\n\nSo as a last step, I generated the static website and uploaded it to my [BlueHost hosting](https://www.bluehost) provider.\n\nAnd don't forget to check in your code into a GIT repo of your choice. In my case, I've checked in my code at BitBucket.org.\n\nHere are the links:\n\n\n\n\t\n  * [SivaVishnu.org Site](http://sivavishnu.org/)\n\n\t\n  * [Source code on BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/vguhesan/sivavishnu.org)\n\n\nHope you enjoyed reading this article. Consider subscribing and sharing!\n\n-- update\n\nFew folks emailed me asking what those fonts were on the site. It's one of the oldest spoken languages that exists in Southern India called [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language).\n\nAnd now for today's inspirational quote:\n\n\nWhen I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left and could say, I used everything you gave me.\n- Erma Bombeck\n\n\n.AUM.\n",

Think of rolling a ball down one side of a hill and up another. The second hill is the barrier and the ball would only have enough energy to climb it to the height from which it was originally dropped. If the second hill was taller, the ball wouldn't be able to roll over it. That's classical physics. Quantum physics and the concept of tunneling means the ball could jump to the other side of the hill with ease or even be found inside the hill – or on both sides of the hill at once.\n\n> \n> \n\t\n>   * Gizmag.com\n> \n\n\n\n\nLearn more at:\n\nhttp://www.gizmag.com/fourth-state-of-water/42999/?li_source=LI&li_medium=default-widget\n\nExample of a [Beryllium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium) crystal's hexagonal (six-sided) crystal-structure arrangement:\n\n![311px-hexagonal_close_packed-svg](/img/2016/06/311px-hexagonal_close_packed-svg.png)\n\n\n### What does this all mean to us?\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n  1. **Microscopically**, the universe continues to marvel us with it's mysteries. If something as simple as water, can display new remarkable properties and states of matter, imaging the permutations and mysteries still locked up when you look at the periodic table of elements as a whole and all the combinations of molecules that exist in nature and some created artificially.\n\n\t\n  2. **Macroscopically**, when you look up on a dark starry night, and you see galaxies upon galaxies and now scientists are debating over multi-verse theories, string theories and [branes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane).  We definitely have a universe full of mysteries to solve.\n\n\nSo we should be fortunate and happy to know that we are living in the best of times where society has evolved beyond our petty differences in beliefs and faith. And we are able to look at each moment in wonder as the universe unveils it's mysteries like a grand operatic in front of us. And one day, our great-great grandchildren and descendants will  look back at the stepping stones we laid for them in this unraveling.\n\nAnd since this is around Father's day, I'm reminded of a proverb in the classical Tamil literature (Book of Proverbs) - [Thirukkural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirukku%E1%B9%9Ba%E1%B8%B7)  written around 2nd or 3rd BCE, on the topic of \"Father\" that reflects my sentiment here:\n\n\nதந்தை மகற்காற்று நன்றி அவையத்து\nமுந்தி இருப்பச் செயல்.\n\nThe benefit which a father should confer on his child is to give him/her precedence in the assembly of the learned.\n\n- [Thirukkural ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirukku%E1%B9%9Ba%E1%B8%B7)\n\n\nWishing everyone a Happy Fathers Day - 2016!\n\nCheers!\n\n\n",

This process is typically described as \"Wait-Until-Port-Opens\" (or it could be the reverse - where you want to wait until a port closes).\n\nHere are some use-cases for this method or script:\n\n\n\n \t\n  * You have a Java web application (Jetty, Tomcat, WildFly, etc) that listens on port 8080 and you want your Nginx or Apache HTTPd server to start as a proxy-server once that back-end web server is bound to port 8080.\n\n \t\n  * You want to spin off your Kong (microserver management) after, your back-end REST server is up and listening on port 123.\n\n \t\n  * Or the reverse, where you want to kick off an email alert-notification, if you are unable to bind to a certain port where your web server runs and it has now crashed.\n\n\nOn a Linux system, this can be accomplished in many ways. Tools like netcat (nc), netstat, telnet makes this very simple. You can write a bash script that accomplishes this easy. But not all footprints may have those libraries installed. For example, if you're switching from CentOS 6.8 to CentOS 7. A lot of the network tools are no longer available or their binaries are not yet ready for prime-time on the new SystemD footprint in CentOS 7. Netcat is one of those tools not yet ready in the CentOS 7. So you will need a common independent way to scan for the port.\n\nFirst, let's look at how this can be done using the above tools:\n\n\n# Depends on netcat (nc)\n# Run netcat and try binding to port 8080 on localhost. \n# If not sleep for five-seconds and repeat until it's available\nwhile ! echo exit | nc localhost 8080; do sleep 5; done\n\n# Variation of the above that depends on netstat utility\nwhile netstat -lnt | awk '$4 ~ /:8080$/ {exit 1}'; do sleep 5; done\n\n# If you know the process-id of your service, then you\nPID=1234\nwhile ! lsof -n -Fn -p $PID | grep -q '^n.*:8080$'; do sleep 5; done\n\n# Variation that depends on netchat (nc)\n# If the port is open, then do nothing but if the port goes down then react\nwhile ! nc -q 1 localhost 8080 ",

This has been the foundation for ages as long I've been using CentOS. But in the latest release of CentOS (CentOS 7+) the init engine has been moved to a more favorable engine labeled SystemD. SystemD is the init engine behind Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat and CentOS. So the standardization is good for the Linux community but moving from CentOS 6.8 to CentOS 7 is not a trivial task (especially when it comes to RPMs that working on the SysV-Init paradigm).\n\nHere are two links that outlines the differences:\n\n\n\n \t\n  * [SystemD vs SysVinit Cheatsheet](http://images.linoxide.com/systemd-vs-sysVinit-cheatsheet-A4.jpg)\n\n \t\n  * [Linux SystemD Commands (how-to guide)](http://linoxide.com/linux-command/linux-systemd-commands/)\n\n\nCheers!\n\n\n\n\n",

You can see some of the devastation that it has caused in this[ link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/07/31/video-and-photo-horrific-flooding-in-ruined-ellicott-city-md/). Fortunately, only my basement had a little bit of flooding. But interestingly, this has been the second flooding in over a month. This made me question the drain at the bottom of the walk-down/walk-up basement.\n\nHere is a picture of the drain at the bottom of the stairwell.\n\n[![20160731_191444](/img/2016/08/20160731_191444.jpg?w=300)](/img/2016/08/20160731_191444.jpg)As you can see the drain hole not the best and it gets blocked with just a few leaves and dirt. I have been clearing the dirt and leaves regularly but when there is a storm, the water floods down from the adjacent wall bringing with it debris which end up clogging the drain hole.\n\nAs a first fix, I tried this from HomeDepot. It's called a drain trap. (shown below)\n\n[![trap1](/img/2016/08/trap1.jpg)](/img/2016/08/trap1.jpg)Again this was good but it did not solve the problem. So I decided to try something different. I needed a frame that was at least 1-in tall giving the dirt a place to settle around it and not flow into the cavity. I also need it to be sturdy where the weight of the frame keeps the mesh/trap down to the ground even in moderate to severe thunderstorms. I searched online for a solution and after spending quite a bit of time searching through blogs, I decided to build one myself.\n\nSo here is the finished product:\n\n[![20160807_164830](/img/2016/08/20160807_164830.jpg?w=1024)](/img/2016/08/20160807_164830.jpg)\n\nHere are the materials I used to build this:\n\n\n\n \t\n  * Chicken-coup mesh grill\n\n \t\n  * four L-brackets\n\n \t\n  * two tree stump posts cut to the size of the chicken-coup (to create a 1in thick frame)\n\n \t\n  * Long plastic corner bead to keep the grill corners from cutting into me with rust over time\n\n \t\n  * outdoor screen plastic to to add a second layer of filtering\n\n \t\n  * Staple gun\n\n \t\n  * Silicone used for household seals\n\n\n[![20160731_190519](/img/2016/08/20160731_190519.jpg?w=576)](/img/2016/08/20160731_190519.jpg)\n\nHere is the frame upside down. It's basically the wood is framed in against the chicken coop metal grill.\n\n[![20160731_190524](/img/2016/08/20160731_190524.jpg?w=300)](/img/2016/08/20160731_190524.jpg)Corners are bracketed in to keep the frame together.\n\nAdded the finer outdoor plastic screen-door screen on top and kept them together with the staple gun. And the last step is to create a seal between the pavement floor and the frame.\n\n[![20160807_164836](/img/2016/08/20160807_164836.jpg?w=1024)](/img/2016/08/20160807_164836.jpg)\n\nAnd voila a gutter guard (that can hopefully withstand some rain). Keeping my fingers crossed.\n\n[![20160807_164830](/img/2016/08/20160807_164830.jpg?w=1024)](/img/2016/08/20160807_164830.jpg)\n\nI will keep this blog post updated as I improvise on my custom made gutter guard. Hopefully others can follow this blueprint and build their own gutter-guards.\n\nCheers.\n",

Last year when we were out camping it rained a little and I had no tarp below my tent. So as soon as I got home last season, I ordered a tarp and had it ready this time. But some lessons are learned the hard way.\n\nLesson Learned: Make sure your tarp's edges are well within the tent's boundary.\n\nIn my case, my tarp was oversized and I had an extra two to three feet all around my tent. And with the worst storm in a while, the border that sticks out collects all the water and the tent in the middle becomes a sponge. Soon enough, we had moisture build up in the tent that we can see a puddle building up inside the tent. I guess you live and learn these lessons.\n\nHere are some of the pictures from the camp:\n\n[![20160731_082523](/img/2016/08/20160731_082523.jpg?w=1024)](/img/2016/08/20160731_082523.jpg)\n\n[![20160730_092210](/img/2016/08/20160730_092210.jpg?w=1024)](/img/2016/08/20160730_092210.jpg)\n\n[Click here for more Photos from camping at Rocky Gap State Park - 2016](https://goo.gl/photos/gxqfoYtWPMFgd4T99)\n\nCheers\n",

Technique is called 'RowHammer'. The trick works by running a program on the target computer, which repeatedly overwrites a certain row of transistors in its DRAM flash memory, “hammering” it until a rare glitch occurs: Electric charge leaks from the hammered row of transistors into an adjacent row. The leaked charge then causes a certain bit in that adjacent row of the computer’s memory to flip from one to zero or vice versa. That bit flip gives you access to a privileged level of the computer’s operating system.\n\n\nLearn more about it here:\n\n[https://www.wired.com/2016/08/new-form-hacking-breaks-ideas-computers-work/](https://www.wired.com/2016/08/new-form-hacking-breaks-ideas-computers-work/)\n",

But for cases, where you are distributing code to be installed in customer sites where you may or may not have a internet connection to the pip libraries, you resort to the legacy setup.py process.\n\nWhen you install using the setup.py process, the setup.py copies it's collection of python files to the site-packages folder for your python virtual-environment. On a CentOS, this might be a location under (/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/) directory. This may also write it's files to other locations such as config files and resource files.\n\nOnce installed and if you decide you want to uninstall or upgrade the package or egg, it's hard to identify all the files that this egg touched. Within the setup.py process there are some other options that can help you in identifying the python files that are placed in these locations. Here is an example of how you can identify the files and remove the files before upgrading.\n\n\n# To note down the list of files that are installed\npython setup.py install --record egg-files.txt\n# To remove those files you can do the following using the egg-files.txt\ncat egg-files.txt | xargs rm -rf\n# This would remove the individual files but will leave the \".egg-info\" directory and other artifacts under site-packages. \n# You can remove the package directories manually\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you have access to pip then you can leverage \"pip freeze\" options ([read more here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_freeze/)) along with \"pip uninstall\" option ([read more here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_uninstall/)).\n\nCheers.\n",

In that way, I know exactly the bits that were installed and nothing more and nothing less. It also eliminates the availability of the NPM modules and network connectivity issues, etc. The following procedure shows you how to create a simple \"Hello World\" Node.js application with one dependency - Express.js (which has dependency on other modules) and to bundle (pack) it and deploy it to an environment that may not have an internet connection.\n\n**Brief Summary:**\n\"bundledDependencies\": [\"package-name1\"] in the package.js does the trick in combination with \"npm pack\" and \"npm install .tar.gz\n\nBelow is the **step-by-step walk-thru.**\n\nSo let's get started:\n**In Development Computer:**\n\nMake sure you have Node.js installed and you can verify the installation by running:\n\n\n$node -v\nv6.8.0\n\n\nNow let's get started on a simple \"Hello World\" - Node.js project:\n\nFollow the steps outlined [here](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) for setting up a simple Hello World using Node.js and Express. In my case, running \"npm install express --save\" created additional module dependencies on the following:\n\n\n$npm install express --save\nguhelloproject\n└─┬ express@4.14.0\n├─┬ accepts@1.3.3\n│ ├─┬ mime-types@2.1.12\n│ │ └── mime-db@1.24.0\n│ └── negotiator@0.6.1\n├── array-flatten@1.1.1\n├── content-disposition@0.5.1\n├── content-type@1.0.2\n├── cookie@0.3.1\n├── cookie-signature@1.0.6\n├─┬ debug@2.2.0\n│ └── ms@0.7.1\n├── depd@1.1.0\n├── encodeurl@1.0.1\n├── escape-html@1.0.3\n├── etag@1.7.0\n├─┬ finalhandler@0.5.0\n│ ├── statuses@1.3.0\n│ └── unpipe@1.0.0\n├── fresh@0.3.0\n├── merge-descriptors@1.0.1\n├── methods@1.1.2\n├─┬ on-finished@2.3.0\n│ └── ee-first@1.1.1\n├── parseurl@1.3.1\n├── path-to-regexp@0.1.7\n├─┬ proxy-addr@1.1.2\n│ ├── forwarded@0.1.0\n│ └── ipaddr.js@1.1.1\n├── qs@6.2.0\n├── range-parser@1.2.0\n├─┬ send@0.14.1\n│ ├── destroy@1.0.4\n│ ├─┬ http-errors@1.5.0\n│ │ ├── inherits@2.0.1\n│ │ └── setprototypeof@1.0.1\n│ └── mime@1.3.4\n├── serve-static@1.11.1\n├─┬ type-is@1.6.13\n│ └── media-typer@0.3.0\n├── utils-merge@1.0.0\n└── vary@1.1.0\n\n\nNow edit, package.js and add define the [bundleDependencies](http://npm.github.io/using-pkgs-docs/package-json/types/bundleddependencies.html) section like so:\n\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"guhelloproject\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"^4.14.0\"\n  },\n  \"bundledDependencies\": [\"express\"]\n}\n\n\nLet's create index.js\n\n\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n  res.send('Hello World!');\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');\n});\n\n\nTest the code locally in development to ensure that it works.\n\n\n$node index.js\nExample app listening on port 3000!\n# You should see \"Hello World\", if you point your browser to http://localhost:3000/\n\n\nNow for the bundling magic.\n\n\n$npm pack\nguhelloproject-1.0.0.tgz\n\n\n**In your Production server (which has no internet connection):**\n\n\n\n \t\n  1. Make sure you install Node.js so that the Node executable is available. Verify once again by running \"node -v\" (as shown above)\n\n \t\n  2. Move the \"guhelloproject-1.0.0.tgz\" file to the Production server.\n\n\n\n\n$npm install guhelloproject-1.0.0.tgz\n# This unzips the bundle into a 'node_modules' directory \n$cd cd node_modules/guhelloproject/\n$node index.js\nExample app listening on port 3000!\n\n\nPoint your browser to http://:3000/ and you should see \"hello world\".\n",

Or you've landed on this page by searching on Google for \"Unable to locate Spring NamespaceHandler for XML schema namespace\" (your actual XML that it's error-ing out may vary).\n\nEither way, you're in luck! Most likely, you're using the fatjar gradle plugin to create a single JAR for executing as \"java -jar one-big-bundle.jar\". The problem that happens is that if two or more dependent jar libraries contain the same file/artifact, then the last one wins the race in the fatjar bundle.\n\nLet me illustrate this with an example:\n\nLet's say that your project depends on Spring-Context and Spring-Core. Within each jar, there maybe resources that have a common name such as META-INF/[spring.schemas](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/extensible-xml.html#extensible-xml-registration-spring-schemas) and/or META-INF/[spring.handler](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/extensible-xml.html#extensible-xml-registration-spring-handlers) (To learn more about the two individual files and their purpose in Spring, click on the links). When the fatjar combines the two JAR file, depending upon who goes last, the version of the above two files may belong to one or the other library. What should happen in reality is that it merges the two files contents. They maybe good for some files. But if you have a specific file in a format where you simply cannot concatenate the two files (such as a nested XML or JSON), simply combining the two files will not work. You may need to extend the Gradle plugin tasks to perform something selective and unique to your situation.\n\nBut if you ended up here after searching for \"Unable to locate Spring NamespaceHandler for XML schema namespace\" message, there is hope.

All bits including the date and time are frozen to that instant. When you restore a snapshot, the Linux guest VM system is restored back to that snapshot including the date and time. This may not be desired all the time especially if the purpose is to restore the configuration and settings to an earlier time but your want to roll forward the clock on the VM to the present instance. The outlined steps below can also apply to other virtual hypervisors like Qemu, VMWare, Amazon S3 images, etc. (essentially where ever you may have a CentOS or Red Hat Linux Virtual instance and with slight modifications the same can be applied to any Linux guest hypervised image)\n\nBelow are a few simple steps you can take to reset the clock:\n\n**Steps to perform before you create a VirtualBox snapshot:**\n\n\n# Install ntp service \nyum -y install ntp\n# Turn it on so that it starts up automatically on reboot\nchkconfig ntpd on\n# Point it to your nearest internet accessable NTP server available around the globe for time-services \nntpdate pool.ntp.org\n# Manually start it up and ensure that it comes up\nservice ntpd start\n\n\n**Now take a VirtualBox snapshot as needed.**\n\n**When you restore a snapshot, do the following after the snapshot is restored:**\n\n\n# After snapshot restore, run \nntpdate pool.ntp.org\n\n\nThat's it! Your date & time should now be updated but all of the other settings and modifications you have done will be restored to it's former glory!\n\n**What is NTP?**\nNTP stands for Network Time Protocol, and it is an Internet protocol used to synchronize the clocks of computers to some time reference.\n\nCheers!\n\n_Today's Inspirational Quotes:_\n\n[![bust_of_marcusaurelius](/img/2016/11/bust_of_marcusaurelius.jpg)](/img/2016/11/bust_of_marcusaurelius.jpg)If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.\n\n- [Marcus Aurelius, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius)[Meditations ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations)\n\n\n\n-AUM\n",

How Malaria is putting mosquitoes as the #1 deadliest lifeform that kills humans? (Interestingly humans are the #2 lifeform that kills our own species) And what has/is being done to change this through the Gates Foundation in the developing countries. As well as the positive, measurable changes that can be seen from the last decade.\n\n \t\n  2. Addresses a underlying issue on foreign aid. Does it work? And this point drives us close to home during this upcoming election in a few days as each American will cast a vote for the next president.\n\n\nHere are some key points taken from Bill Gates'  blog [[GatesNotes.com](http://GatesNotes.com)] on this article.\n\n\nMalaria is the key reason mosquitoes are the [deadliest animal in the world](http://b-gat.es/2dJLpHD). **Rigorous new data show that the malaria death rate in sub-Saharan Africa has declined by a stunning 57% since 2000**. With almost 500,000 children still dying of malaria every year, we obviously have a long way to go. But cutting the death rate by more than half is a miracle. It’s one of the greatest success stories in the history of global health.\n\nFirst, we’ll need new classes of drugs that completely clear malaria parasites from the body\n\nSecond, we need new tools that can prevent malaria transmission.\n\nToday, this is no longer a lonely fight. More than 50 countries have joined together to mobilize billions of dollars through [The Global Fund](http://b-gat.es/2dLadxG). ...these resources are coming not just from wealthy countries. African countries such as Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, and Zimbabwe are contributing...In fact, African countries are now, for the first time ever, mobilizing more of their own resources for malaria than they’re receiving from donors.\n\nSo the next time you hear skeptics charging that foreign aid doesn’t work, point to malaria. Foreign assistance has not chased away local resources. On the contrary, it’s encouraged African nations to step up their own health efforts. And the results have been nothing short of remarkable.\n\n\nRead the full article at\n\n[https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Mapping-the-End-of-Malaria](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Mapping-the-End-of-Malaria)\n\nCheers!\n\n_Today's (two) Inspirational Quotes:_\n\n\n[![asokathegreat](/img/2016/11/asokathegreat.jpg)](/img/2016/11/asokathegreat.jpg)+ No society can prosper if it aims at making things easier-instead it should aim at making people stronger.\n+ All men are my children.

While still included in many Linux Distributions, (and you may be tempted to run - 'yum install net-tools' - to get them back into your Linux footprint). But they are considered **deprecated** and therefore should be phased out in favor of more modern replacements. If you visit the link to [net-tools project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/net-tools/files/?source=navbar) [and [here](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/net-tools)] you will see that the last build of the tar.bz2 file was sometime back in October 14th, 2011.\n\nThis opens up some possibility for security vulnerabilities that may not get adequately patched. When you are developing applications for the Linux Platforms or running server configurations on Linux out in the cloud, you should move away from leveraging the net-tools as part of your portfolio. You will also notice that the modern tools leverage multi-core processing & parallelization (in some cases) to speed things up and you may notice a slight performance improvement in some of the commands. If your script is iterating through a collection running a certain net-tools command, your script will see a noticeable difference in time.\n\nThe CentOS 7 team has decided to move to [iproute2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproute2) but some of the commands are not as trivial and requires a bit of familiarization before you can readily use it.\n\nFor example, the **ss** command that aids in determining if a port is open or used when compared with **netstat** can yield faster results because it directly queries the kernel using [Netlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlink) and the classic [sockets](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7356) API rather than going through the **proc-fs** file system (/proc/net/tcp) to acquire the system network information.

Then most likely you want to leverage a common library accessible to all the various libraries. In this case, you're going to depend on either sendmail or mailx.   Now let us throw in a additional problem into this mix. Suppose you are developing on a Windows platform but the end application is targeted to run on Linux. This now creates a new additional problem. Sendmail or Mailx do not exist for Windows. Well, this article provides a way to develop on Windows by invoking execute mailx calls from your native code to the underlying emulation of Linux on Windows.\n\nNow that we have established the problem, let us walk through a solution.\n\nPlease note that this is not the only solution but a potential solution. If you know of other mechanisms, feel free to send me a link and I'll add them in.\n\n\n## Solution\n\n\n**Step-1**: Make sure that you have Cygwin installed (with email tool selected additionally) on your Windows computer.\n\n\n# Download  setup-x86_64.exe from https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe\n# and run it.\n\n# When you run the setup, please additionally select \"email\" tool additionally. It is not added by default.\n\n\nOnce Cygwin is installed, most people traditionally use all the Cygwin tools from within a Cygwin Command-Prompt. The executables are located under \"\\bin\\**\" directory. Which means that if you run a \"ls\" in a DOS command-prompt, it will error saying \"command not found\". There is a undocumented\\not so known secret to emulating Linux commands natively in Windows. This is where your true Linux power comes in under native Windows.\n\n**Step-2**: Add Cygwin\\bin path natively to Windows PATH.\n\n\n# In my computer, I have Cygwin installed at the following path: c:\\cygwin64\\\n\nTo add \"c:\\cygwin64\\bin\" the system path, perform these steps:\n\n1. Start the System Control Panel applet (Start - Settings - Control Panel - System).\n2. Select the Advanced tab.\n3. Click the Environment Variables button.\n4. Under System Variables, select Path, then click Edit.\n5. Add c:\\cygwin64\\bin to the path.\n\n\n\nOnce Step-2 is completed. If you start a new DOS command-prompt and run a \"ls\" command, you should see the directory listing (same as a 'dir' command under Windows).\n\n**Step-3**: The send email application uses \"c:\\cygwin64\\etc\\email\\email.conf\" for SMTP and other email properties.\n\n\n# Edit c:\\cygwin64\\etc\\email\\email.conf and add your SMTP details (domain/server name, user-id, password)\n# For this example, I have setup a *special* GMail Email account specially to test [Don't use your private GMail] so I will use the user-id and password for that Gmail account.\n\nSMTP_SERVER = 'smtp.gmail.com'\nSMTP_PORT = '587'\nUSE_TLS = 'true'\nSMTP_AUTH = 'LOGIN'\nSMTP_AUTH_USER = 'YOUR_TEST_GMAIL_ADDRESS@gmail.com'\nSMTP_AUTH_PASS = 'YOUR_GMAIL_PASSWORD_GOES_HERE'\nMY_NAME  = 'Venkatt Guhesan'\nMY_EMAIL = 'foobar7634@gmail.com'\n\n\n\n**Step-4**: Let's test this under a DOS command-prompt.\n\n\n# Open a DOS Command-Prompt and run the following:\n\necho \"Test from Cygwin in Windows under DOS command-prompt\" | email -s \"Testing Email from Windows DOS\" recipient_email_address@gmail.com \n\n# Within minutes, you should see an email in the Gmail inbox as expected.\n\n# If you are not seeing it, then you can use the example below where you can pass in the SMTP arguments for validation. Maybe you typed in the password for the Gmail account incorrectly or you entered one of the parameters incorrectly in the c:\\cygwin64\\etc\\email\\email.conf file.\n\n############### HERE IS AN EXAMPLE WITH SMTP PARAMETERS PASSED IN AS ARGUMENTS #######################\necho \"Test from Cygwin in Windows under DOS command-prompt\" | email -s \"Tetsing Email\" recipient_email_address@gmail.com -r smtp.gmail.com -p 587 -m login -u YOUR_TEST_GMAIL_ADDRESS@gmail.com -i YOUR_GMAIL_PASSWORD_GOES_HERE -tls\n######################################################################################################\n\n\n[![ss1](/img/2016/12/ss1.jpg?w=1024)](/img/2016/12/ss1.jpg)\n\nOnce you have confirmed a successful email then the next step is to create a mailx application.\n\n**Step-5**: Create a mailx.exe (mailx) within Cygwin's bin directory.\n\nFor emulating mailx from Cygwin's email.exe, you're in luck. The format for mailx is identical to the email.exe's arguments. All you are missing is mailx.exe. So simply copy email.exe under Cygwin's bin directory to mailx.exe under the same Cygwin's bin directory. And you're all set!\n\n\n# simply copy email.exe under Cygwin's bin directory to mailx.exe under the same Cygwin's bin directory\n\ncd c:\\cygwin64\\bin\ncp email.exe mailx.exe\n\n# Now just like you running email (without the .exe suffix) you can run mailx (without the .exe suffix)\n\n\n\n**Step-6**: Test sending an email using mailx\n\n\n\necho \"Test from Cygwin-mailx in Windows under DOS command-prompt\" | mailx -s \"Testing Email from Windows DOS\" recipient_email_address@gmail.com \n\n\n\n[![ss2](/img/2016/12/ss2.jpg?w=1024)](/img/2016/12/ss2.jpg)\n\nAs a last step, now within your Java application, test Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"mailx command\");\n\n\nRuntime.getRuntime().exec(\"echo 'Test from Cygwin-mailx in Windows under DOS command-prompt' | mailx -s 'Testing Email from Windows DOS' recipient_email_address@gmail.com\");\n\n\nNow your Java application as well as any Python, Bash, Linux shell applications and/or scripts are now leveraging the common \"mailx\" and your development is now consistently the same using one common mailx library.\n\nCheers!\n\n\n\n\n_Today's inspirational quote:_\n\n\n\n\n![theodore-roosevelt](/img/2016/12/theodore-roosevelt.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t\n  * We must all either wear out or rust out, every one of us.

Realize what is up to us and what is not up to us.\n\n\nWe can control our emotions, our decisions, our perspectives, and our desires. We have a say in how these things go. These are things that are _up to us_. We can’t control what other people think, the state of the economy, the president elect, the traffic, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nBetween the two, we face a choice on what we focus on – what is under our control or what is not.\n\n\n\n\nIf we choose to focus on the things that we can control, we can make progress, we can grow and learn and reach our goals.\n\n\n\n\nYou have power over your mind – not outside events.

This technology can be applied in a variety of fields such that the chain cannot be owned by a single entity and has no single point of failure. It provides a backbone with transparency and incorruptibility. Imagine a world where every transaction, whether it is a real-estate property transaction or a work-contract or an acknowledgement receipt of a email or an acceptance of work or payment or a medication delivery system releasing a medication into a patients blood-stream can be recorded such that it is indisputable and irrevocable. Furthermore, tampering a single unit or transaction in this chain of information will require a huge amount of computing power.\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about Blockchain see the following article on BlockGeeks:\n\n\nWhat is a blockchain technology?\n[http://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/](http://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/)\n\n\n",

Clustering/distributed architecture is out of the scope of the Chronicle Map project, there are projects _on top_ of Chronicle Map which address these questions, e. g. [Chronicle Enterprise](http://chronicle.software/products/chronicle-enterprise/).\n\n\nIf your needs are to persist off-heap data on the local JVM to disk (and to have multiple processes interact with data within one physical machine) then you can use the open-source edition but if your needs are to talk across JVMs that are across IPs (physical/virtual machines) for synchronization/replication features then you are looking at the closed source (paid) version of their product stack as seen from this [link](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map#features).

Artificial Intelligence will enable more complex combinations of code to be fit together through an automated process... The quantity and quality of customization with AI will be staggering. And for the end user this means it will be at once simpler and cheaper... CaaS via AI will not be limited to people making ‘interesting’ websites. Ultimately CaaS will drive down the time and money necessary for new capabilities in spaces from enterprise to social. But in the near term CaaS will affect programmers who complete relatively simple or scripted tasks, like querying databases for example. No longer will we need armies of coders who expertly understand how to fit if else statements within loops, whether to use Ruby or Angular. AI will be able to do this much faster, with fewer errors, and a greater understanding of system requirements.\n\n\nRead more about it at the link below:\n\n[https://hackernoon.com/the-future-of-web-development-coding-as-a-service-e413c978f77e#.bslzklff4](https://hackernoon.com/the-future-of-web-development-coding-as-a-service-e413c978f77e#.bslzklff4)\n",

Now instead of simply providing a volume with a capacity, reliability and performance characteristic they can provide a dynamic storage platform that can support, tiered storage, high performance backups, integrated archive and still provide the high performance demanded by their current block storage customers.\n\n\nThis article is a good read. It starts first by describing \"what is a block storage?\". It then moves into the transformation happening with commoditization of storage into a cloud environment where you are moving from a typical SAN environment to a TCP/IP based storage clusters. And the article ends with how every tier in the data-management will become commoditized/virtualized in the cloud.\n\nIt would be interesting to hear the author's (Scott Fadden) view today since that article was written back in July 2015 and we are in the midst of that transformation with KVM's [virtIO](https://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Virtio), Open Stack's [Cinder](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Cinder) plugins.\n\nSource: [IBM Spectrum Scale Wiki : Scott's Blog](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/General%20Parallel%20File%20System%20(GPFS)/page/Scott%27s%20Blog)\n",

        "content": "\n[![](/img/2016/09/python_logo.png)](/img/2016/09/python_logo.png)\n\nuvloop is a fast, drop-in replacement of the built-in asyncio event loop. uvloop is implemented in Cython and uses libuv under the hood.\n\n**Benefits**: uvloop makes asyncio 2-4x faster.\n\n**Cons**: uvloop is available from PyPI but it requires Python 3.5. (The reason for this is asyncio was introduced in Python 3.4 and above.) Unless your project is based on Python 3.4+ - you may not be able to leverage this library.\n\n**Alternatives**: For the folks that are using Python 2.7 (including me), if you search for \"asyncio alternatives\" you will quickly come across the Trollius project. But unfortunately this project is no longer under development. Eventually, you will arrive a discussion on GIL and multi-cores like this [article](http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python3/multicore_python.html). Yes, the Python community is torn between 2.7 and 3.x. Your best bet at this point of time for Python 2.7 users is to leverage [Tornado's async](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/async.html) facility using Callbacks, futures, promises and deferred.  A hybrid but elegant alternative is to use [Cyclone](http://cyclone.io/) (Takes Tornado's elegance and applies it to [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) library).\n\nRead more about uvloop here: [https://goo.gl/lEC7tt](https://goo.gl/lEC7tt)\n\nTo learn more about the other libraries mentioned here refer to this blog article:\n[https://goo.gl/TDkEkJ](https://goo.gl/TDkEkJ)\n\nCheers!\n",

Artificial intelligence doesn’t work all that well in situations where there is very little data, such as drug development.\n\nA new technique called one-shot learning, that requires only a small number of data points might be a solution to that low-data problem.\n\nTo make molecular information more digestible, the researchers first represented each molecule in terms of the connections between atoms (what a mathematician would call a graph). This step highlighted intrinsic properties of the chemical in a form that an algorithm could process.\n\nWith these graphical representations, the group trained an algorithm on two different datasets—one with information about the toxicity of different chemicals and another that detailed side effects of approved medicines. From the first dataset, they trained the algorithm on six chemicals and had it make predictions about the toxicity of the other three. Using the second dataset, they trained it to associate drugs with side effects in 21 tasks, testing it on six more.\n\nIn both cases, the algorithm was better able to predict toxicity or side effects than would have been possible by chance.\n\n\nArticle: [http://www.futurity.org/one-shot-learning-algorithm-1394022/](http://www.futurity.org/one-shot-learning-algorithm-1394022/)\n\nLearn more  [One-Shot Learning\n](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-shot_learning)\n\n\n",

A nanofridge that sorts electrons by temperature just might keep it cool enough to allow quantum compute.\n\n\nClassical computers require built-in fans and other ways to dissipate heat, and quantum computers are no different. Instead of working with bits of information that can be either 0 or 1, as in a classical machine, a quantum computer relies on “qubits”, which can be in both states simultaneously – called a superposition – thanks to the quirks of quantum mechanics. Those qubits must be shielded from all external noise, since the slightest interference will destroy the superposition, resulting in calculation errors. Well-isolated qubits heat up easily, so keeping them cool is a challenge.\n\n...\n\nOver time the process has a selective chilling effect on the electrons as well: the hotter electrons jump the gap, while the cooler ones are left behind. The process removes heat from the system, much like how a refrigerator functions.\n\n\nSource: [Nanofridge could keep quantum computers cool enough to calculate | New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130210-nanofridge-could-keep-quantum-computers-cool-enough-to-calculate/)\n",

But there’s a problem—very few people know how to work them. The bold claim of achieving \"quantum supremacy\" came on the back of Google unveiling a new quantum chip design. The hyperbolic phrase essentially means building a quantum device that can perform a calculation impossible for any conventional computer.\n\nThe technology has a major challenge to overcome. Programming these devices is much harder than programming conventional computers.\n\nFor a start, building algorithms for these machines requires a certain level of understanding about the quantum physics that gives qubits their special properties. While you don’t need an advanced physics degree to get your head around it, it is a big departure from traditional computer programming.\n\n\nSource: [Quantum Computing Demands a Whole New Kind of Programmer](https://singularityhub.com/2017/05/09/quantum-computing-demands-a-whole-new-kind-of-programmer/)\n",

It can capture all of the the environmental data needed to transform a wide variety of ordinary household objects into smart devices.\n\nPlug the module into an electrical outlet and it becomes the eyes and ears of the room, its 10 embedded sensors logging information like sound, humidity, electromagnetic noise, motion, and light (the researchers excluded a camera for privacy reasons). Machine learning algorithms translate that data into context-specific information about what’s happening in the room.\n\n\nMore importantly, I like this project because I've spotted a Particle Photon embedded at the core of the Synthetic Sensor.\n\nSource: [Synthetic Sensors Is a Sensor That Could Soon Make Homes Scary-Smart](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/supercharged-sensor-soon-make-homes-scary-smart/)\n",

Instead, we can grow them right where we are -- even in cities. Eco-entrepreneur and TED Fellow Shubhendu Sharma grows ultra-dense, biodiverse mini-forests of native species in urban areas by engineering soil, microbes and biomass to kickstart natural growth processes. Follow along as he describes how to grow a 100-year-old forest in just 10 years, and learn how you can get in on this tiny jungle party.\n\nRelated Links:\n\n\n\n\t\n  * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Miyawaki\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Miyawaki)The term is called \"**Miyawaki method\"**\n\n\t\n  * ** ****[https://fellowsblog.ted.com/how-to-grow-a-forest-really-really-fast-d27df202ba09](https://fellowsblog.ted.com/how-to-grow-a-forest-really-really-fast-d27df202ba09)**\n\n\t\n  * ** ****[https://www.ted.com/talks/shubhendu_sharma_an_engineers_vision_for_tiny_forests_everywhere](https://www.ted.com/talks/shubhendu_sharma_an_engineers_vision_for_tiny_forests_everywhere)**\n\n\t\n  * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Nammalvar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Nammalvar)\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "\nSummary\n\nThanks to Hugo Static Site generator written in GoLang and Mainroad Theme, I was able to port over my personal blog MyThinkPond as a static generated website.\n\n Before and After\n\nHere is a screenshot of the belore site:\n\nMyThinkPond under Wordpress hosting\n\n{{img src=\"/img/2017/09/MyThinkPond-Screenshot-befoew.jpg\" alt=\"MyThinkPond under Wordpress\" width=\"640\" align=\"center\" class=\"imgframe\"}}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the belore site:\n\nMyThinkPond under Wordpress hosting\n\n{{img src=\"/img/2017/09/MyThinkPond-Screenshot-after.jpg\" alt=\"MyThinkPond under Hugo\" width=\"640\" align=\"center\" class=\"imgframe\"}}\n\nI think it's a move in the right direction. Putting me in complete control of the content, images and all artifacts that goes into bundling the site.\n\nWhy move away from Wordpress.com Hosted Blog?\n\nHere are some reasons why I made the switch:\n\nFelt locked down with their free with ads or paid model.\nI needed to add some plugins available under Wordpress but since it is hosted under Wordpress.com, the paid version that allowed me to install the plugins was quite expensive (and only an annual payment option was available.)\nExport option is very misleading. The comments on the site makes it sound like you own your content. But what gets bundled in the Export option is only an XML containing the blog content with URLs for all the image resources. \n\n\tFirst, you need to write some nifty script to extract all URLs out of the XML document.\n\n\tSecond, if you had more images under Media compared to the ones you linked then there is no clear way to download them except to create a page with all the images and then using a download software to pull down all the images.\n\n\tThird, since Wordpress auto-scales the images to save on bandwidth, if you had a resized image on a blog page, then your download will contain the downsized image and not the original image. Unless you do some URL manupulation to arrive at the original image.\n\nTo install a Wordpress plugin such as Downloader requires a paid annual Business account. This is not worth the cost.\nMy cost to maintain the site was going up as I was adding individual services such as an SSL HTTPS site and ad-free and so on. Not worth the annual cost.\nNoticed inconsistent load speeds of the same page throughout the day.\nSupporting Videos required additional fees.\nNot happy with the new admin interface. Eventhough it was designed to help the admin-user focus, I felt that the interface was making me go through loops to get something done.\nFelt locked down with the short-URLs and eco-system. I noticed that over the years I have beeen using their short-URLs all over the place and now changing blog sites was becoming a dream. It felt that it's now or never.\n10. Needed to version my content and being able to push the content into a GIT repository seemed like the missing ingredient that I needed.\n\n Why Hugo?\n\nHere are some things that attracted me to Hugo:\n\nSee my earlier article Hugo and Jekyll Compared. I have already done another website for a temple as a prototype using Hugo. See SivaVishnu.org \nWith Hugo, it is one executable that's platform agnostic (Mac, Windows, Linux - coverage) for content creation. Deployment is the same for both Hugo and Jekyll. They both generate static content hosted on any flavor of web-server.\nFelt comfortable working with Hugo written in GoLang than with Jekyll written in Ruby.\n\nBut if you are considering switching you should look at this site - StaticGen. You will see that Jekyll has more hits with respect to development, forks and fewer bug counts. \n\nTips and Tricks\n\n Conversion Woes\n\nConverting the Wordpress hosted site directly to Hugo was not easy. Here are the steps that I had to take:\n\nRun Export under Wordpress Admin. This generates an XML file with all the blog content.\nWrite a Linux regular-expression parser that pulled all the Media (JPG, GIF, PNG) links out of the XML.\nDownload the media files using wget (while retaining the folder structure of the media files).\nIdentify the missing Media files that was not linked in any Wordpress blog content. I had about 30 images that did not have a link. Added those 30+ images to a temporary blog page.\nUsed a FireFox Media Downloader plugin to download those 30+ images (while retaining the folder path to the images). \nUse Jekyll's Wordpress XML to Jekyll converter utility (works with Python 2.7). ExitWP\nGenerated Jekyll site contains all Media resources still pointing to https://mythinkpond.files.wordpress.com/. Converted the URLs to all relative static path within the /static/img/** directory.\nThen I used Hugo's Jekyll import command found at this location. hugo import jekyll. This transformed my Jekyll site to Hugo based static site.\nInvestigated the variety of Themes available under Hugo and settled on Mainroad.\n10. Created some custom shortcodes to deal with IMG tags. Hugo does not provide a easy to use tag that can allow me to control the height and width of a img tag. The expectation is that it will be controlled via a style. With varying sizes for my images, it's hard to create many, many image style tags for each. So, I resorted to created a custom shortcode to deal with this.\n11. Enabled highlight.js for the Programming Code Syntax Highlighter functionality.\n12. Enabled Disqus for comments feature. (Although I cannot test it until it's live.)\n13. Decided to leave the default Google Site Search (eventhough it is reported to go away)\n14. Customized the Theme to include a background heade image. Some minor color changes. Chaged the theme to be full-width site for large UHD monitors. (Why waste the real-estate when you don't need to).\n15. Edit each of the converted content to fix syntax and image resizes, thumbnails, etc. (Just got through the first set - still have few hundered more blog articles to go).\n16. Generate \"public\" static site version.\n17. Deciding on where it will be cheap to host the static HTML website. Now that I no longer have the complexity of a Wordpress/PHP hosting, I have many, many options available.\n\nLaunch Site and change Nameservers (Yet to be done)\n\n Some missing features\n\nAuto-Social-Posting feature. Within Wordpress, when I published an article, it automatically sent a blurb of the post to social sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, etc. I need to figure out what my options are here with a static site. Maybe this is a feature that can be added by someone into Hugo. (Repost to Social Sites)\nJet-Pack features that auto notified subscribers with a gist of any new article I published.\nI am going to loose my present subscribers. I will need to find a way to bring them back. Wordpress does not give me the email IDs of my subscribers. So I may need to post a farewell blog on the Wordpress version of MyThinkPond and ask them to resubscribe under the new Static sites functionality. Maybe Feedburner is a good replacement for this.\nContact-Me functioanlity will need to be built.\nAll the one-million or so plugins available under Wordpress. Eventhough I do not depend on them at this time but Wordpress has built a nice little eco-stream that has helped developers earn some serios bucks on Themes and Plugins.\n\nSo hopefully, you found this article worth while. \n\nPS: If you are reading this article, then I have successfully made the switch and you are now looking at the new MyThinkPond blog site. :-)\n\nCheers!\n\n \n\n",

        "content": "\nSummary\n\nThis article focus on how to setup Jumbo packets on all your various devices in your network. This includes Windows 10+, Linux, Mac OS X+.\n\n What is Jumbo packet or Jumbo Frame?\n\n A jumbo frame is an Ethernet frame with a payload greater than the standard maximum transmission unit (MTU) of 1,500 bytes. Jumbo frames are used on local area networks that support at least 1 Gbps and can be as large as 9,000 bytes.\n -- Definition from WhatIs.com\n\n{{img src=\"/img/2017/10/jumbo-frames.gif\" alt=\"Jumbo Framess\" width=\"250\" align=\"center\" class=\"imgframe\"}}\n\nWhen you purchase [1Gb] Gigabit or 10GB switches and routers lately, you may have seen something on the specifications that may say something like this \"supports Jumbo packets\" or \"Jumbo Frame support\". If you are one of the lucky ones that has a switch that supports Jumbo packets, chances are that you may not have configured your devices to leverage this Jumbo packet technology and may be suffering from network lags that could have been easily avoided.\n\nIf you are shopping for a new switch then take a look at a few of the Trendnet switches that supports jumbo packets:\n\n  Trendnet 16-port switch on Amazon - ~$52\n  TP-Link 8-port switch on Amazon - ~$25\n\nHow will this help me?\n\nSuppose you are copying a very large file (like a movie or your mp3 collection from one computer to another computer) or streaming movies or files, then it requires all three parties to have enabled jumbo packet support for the transmission to be effective. The sender (source-computer), the receiver (target-computer) and the switch (middle-man). If any one of them is not configured for jumbo packet support then you're not really moving data in the most optimal way possible.\n\nNote: This is not applicable to WiFi connections since wifi speeds are not nearly close to direct wired at this time.\n\nSo let's get to business on how you can configure Jumbo Frame/Packet support for each of your devices in your network.\n\n MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit)\n\nThe Jumbo Frames support or Jumbo Packets are controlled at your network card level and is typically associated with MTU (maximum transfer unit) property of your network settings. Most OS's have a default of 1,500 bytes. And Jumbo Frames can support upto 9,000 bytes per packet.\n\nDetermine what your router or switch supports by looking into the Router or Switch specifications. You will need to set the MTU parameter accordingly in the next sections.\n\nConfiguring Jumbo Packets/Jumbo Frames in Linux\n\n CentOS/Red Hat/Ubuntu variety of Linux\n\nprecode class=\"language-bash line-numbers\"# To check your MTU size\n$ ip link show | grep mtu\n\nTo Set a new mtu size\n$ ip link set eth0 mtu 9000\n\n Above change is only temporary, when you reboot your computer you\nwill be back to 1500.\n To make the above change permanent add this as part of your startup script\n\n/code/pre\n\nPre-CentOS 7 versions of Linux (that supports ifconfig)\n\nprecode class=\"language-bash line-numbers\"ifconfig eth0 mtu 9000 up\n\n/code/pre\n\n Mac OS X\n\nprecode class=\"language-bash line-numbers\"# To check your MTU size\n$ networksetup -getMTU en0\n\nTo Set a new mtu size\n$ networksetup -setMTU en0 9000\n\n/code/pre\n\nAlso follow this article on how to do this using your Network setting GUI:\nChanging it on the Mac GUI\n\n Windows 10 (not tested)\n\n Have Windows, let me know if this works\n\nprecode class=\"language-bash line-numbers\"# Open command-prompt in Administrative mode\n\nTo check your MTU size\n$ netsh interface ipv4 show subinterfaces\n\n To Set a new mtu size\n$ netsh interface ipv4 set subinterface \"Local Area Connection\" mtu=nnnn store=persistent\nwhere\n   Local Area Connection is the name of the network connection on your\ncomputer, from the list obtained above.\n   nnnn is the desired value for MTU.\n/code/pre\n\nCheers!\n\nToday's Quote\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/logo/zen.png\" caption=\"\" width=\"100\" class=\"alignleft round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\nbr/\nBefore Enlightenment - chop wood, carry water.br/\nAfter enlightenment - chop wood, carry water.br/\nZen Proverb\n\n&nbsp;\n",

        "title": "Spring Framework - Application Context - three ways to get to the application context",
        "content": "\n\nThis article shows you three different ways how to get to the Spring Framework Application Context in your code. \n\nSummary\n\n(This is a repost of an older article I wrote in 2010). \nIn searching Google for \"Spring ApplicationContextAware\", you will come across a lot of recommendations and I also see a lot of folks continuing to complain saying that their setApplicationContext method does not get invoked. So to help clarify, I'm blogging a few notes in hope that it helps clarify how the context works.\n\n Method-1\n\nIn your class you implement ApplicationContextAware class like this:\n\nprecode class=\"language-java line-numbers\"public class MyClass implements ApplicationContextAware {\n\n    static final long serialVersionUID = 02L;\n\n    ApplicationContext applicationContext = null;\n\n    public void doSomething(){\n        if (applicationContext != null && applicationContext.containsBean(\"accessKeys\")){\n            MyBean beanA = (MyBean) applicationContext.getBean(\"mybean\");\n            //Do something with this AccessBean\n        }\n\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setApplicationContext(final ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException {\n        System.out.println(\"setting context\");\n        this.applicationContext = applicationContext;\n    }\n\n}\n/code/pre\n\nMethod-2\n\nIf you are in a Java Servlet, you can do the following:\n\nprecode class=\"language-java line-numbers\"public class gzservlet extends HttpServlet {\n    static final long serialVersionUID = 02L;\n\n    ApplicationContext applicationContext = null;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {\n        if (applicationContext == null){\n            System.out.println(\"setting context in get\");\n            applicationContext = WebApplicationContextUtils.getWebApplicationContext(this.getServletContext());\n        }\n        if (applicationContext != null && applicationContext.containsBean(\"accessKeys\")){\n            AccessBean thisAccessBean = (AccessBean) applicationContext.getBean(\"accessKeys\");\n            req.setAttribute(\"keys\", thisAccessBean.toString());\n            System.out.println(\"setting keys\");\n        }\n\n        req.getRequestDispatcher(\"/index2.jsp\").include(req,resp);\n    }\n\n}\n/code/pre\n\nSo the question one would ask is when to use what? And the answer is. Depends on how you are invoking Spring.\n\nWhat works for Method 1: when you invoke Spring you are using the DispatcherServlet link this. Then Method #1 will resolve the implementation of ApplicationContextAware and call the setApplicationContext() method to set the context.\n\nIn web.xml:\n\nscript type=\"text/plain\" class=\"language-markup\"\nservlet\n\tservlet-namedispatchservlet/servlet-name\n\tservlet-classorg.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet/servlet-class\n\tload-on-startup1/load-on-startup\n/servlet\n\nservlet-mapping\n\tservlet-namedispatchservlet/servlet-name\n\turl-pattern/*/url-pattern\n/servlet-mapping\n/script\n\nIf you are not using the DispatcherServlet and you are initializing Spring using a Listener and you have your own Servlet that's driving the Request\\Response scope then use Method #2. Below is an example of how the web.xml will look like in this case.\n\nscript type=\"text/plain\" class=\"language-markup\"\nlistener\n   listener-classorg.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener/listener-class\n/listener\n\nservlet\n  servlet-nameMyOwnServlet/servlet-name\n  servlet-classcom.something.myservlet/servlet-class\n  load-on-startup2/load-on-startup\n/servlet\n\nservlet-mapping\n  servlet-nameMyOwnServlet/servlet-name\n  url-pattern*.do/url-pattern\n/servlet-mapping\n/script\n\nI hope this clarifies why sometimes even though you have implemented the ApplicationContextAware interface, your setter does not get invoked.\n\n[09/12/2010] Here is a third way to get your context:\n\nCreate the following class with a static method to get your context:\n\nprecode class=\"language-java line-numbers\"\nimport org.springframework.beans.BeansException;\nimport org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;\nimport org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextAware;\n\npublic class ApplicationContextProvider implements ApplicationContextAware{\n\tprivate static ApplicationContext ctx = null;\n \tpublic static ApplicationContext getApplicationContext() {\n\t\treturn ctx;\n \t}\n \tpublic void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext ctx) throws BeansException {\n\t\tthis.ctx = ctx;\n \t}\n}\n/code/pre\n\nand in your spring bean configuration xml file add the following:\n\nscript type=\"text/plain\" class=\"language-markup\"\nbean id=\"applicationContextProvider\" class=\"ApplicationContextProvider\"/bean\n/script\n\nAnd now in your classes, you can do the following:\n\nprecode class=\"language-java line-numbers\"    \nApplicationContext ctx = ApplicationContextProvider.getApplicationContext();\n/code/pre\n\nThat's it!!!\n\nCheers.\n\nblockquoteIf you find this article useful, consider signing up for my email or repost this on your favorite social site.

        "content": "\nDear Reader: I read this article on my cousin's Facebook page (links below) and it was originally written in Tamil language. I was inspired when I read it and unfortunately Auto-Translate did not do a great job at translating this story and so this Thanks Giving - I wanted to translate this artcle into Engish so that the Engish-speaking readers can be inspired this Thanks Giving holiday of 2017. With a little bit of Encouragement and with Desire, Stength and Determination - all things are possible!\n\nNow for the story:\n\nOriginal Tamil Article on Facebook\n\nIf you walk on the beautiful beaches of India, it is traditional to find people selling snacks such as roasted peanuts, sliced mangos and savory snacks for all the vistors enjoying the beautiful sunsets and sunrise at the beaches. If you happened to be at the beaches of Pudhucheri, India, you may run into this young man shown in the picture above selling peanuts and other snacks.\n\nWhat you may not know or realize is that this young man is an BA (Bachelor of Art), MA (Master of Art), MPhil (Master of Philosophy) degree holder and that he is at present working towards his PhD (Doctrate).\n\n\"Our family comes from poverty and modest beginnings. Father - Subramanian - a clerk at a local department store that sells fabrics, Mother - Saraswati, 2 elder sisters, 2 brothers, 1 younger sister with a total of six children total. The marriage to my elder sister happened under these hard poverty circumstances.\" says Palaniraj.\n\n\"Because of this struggle in the family, the decision was made that the young boys in the family will set out seeking odd jobs to support the family. It was back in 1998, I was in 8th grade (standard in India). Me and my brother Saravanakumar decided to seek jobs.\n\nWe both like to read and education was on our mind all the time. But considering the struggles, sitting at the beach in Pudhucheri - we decided to sell streamed-peanuts (Sundal) to make a living.\n\nAt first, selling peanuts was a struggle. I am a very quite guy and raising my voice to screem at my top of my lungs saying 'peanuts-peanuts-peanuts' took a lot of my energy out of us (especially on a hungry stomach).\n\nSome days the peanuts will not sell. We didn't know what to do when they do not sell. We can eat some of it but the remaining goes to waste. \n\nOn one end, my family barely ate while on the other hand we had a bucket full of peanuts that were going bad. \n\nWe barely had any proper clothes to wear. And so somedays, I will wear my elder brothers clothes to look decent when I sell the peanuts.\n\nOver time, others came to know that I was attending school during the day and selling peanuts at the beach in the evenings. At this time, I was attending the Veeramamunivar Government School.\n\nThe teachers Ms.Padmavathi, Mr.Balasundaram, Mr.Ramdas at my school that realized my situation - came to my aid. They helped where they could.\n\nSelling peanuts I finished my 10th grade (standard) and scored 442 points on the exam. (Translators comment: In India, your 10th grade central board exams define your life moving forward. The better the scores, the better your opportunities in life).\n\nAfter graduation, I joined Va Vu Si Higher Scondary School to pursue my 11th and 12th grade and completed them successfully all while selling peanuts at the beach at nights.\n\nLater with aspirations to study further, I joined the local Thagoor College  where I pursued BA in Tamil. \n\nAfter which, I completed MA and MPhil.\n\nDuring my education,in 2008 I took the net training and exam and in 2013 JRF [Junior Resident Faculty] training and exam (equivalent to a teaching assistant) which brought me some additional money to support the family.\n\nInspite of this improvement in my life, it was not enough and so even today, I am selling peanuts at the beaches.\n\nAs my father got older, he was unable to work and so each morning, I wake up goto the local shops to buy fresh ingredients to make peanuts, falafel (vada), fried-vegitables (dumplings). My mother prepares them and get them ready.\n\nI attend my college for my PhD and I return home after 6pm each day and I take the prepared snacks to the beach and to Nehru street (popular street by the beach where the young crowd hang around) to sell.\n\nI return home at 10pm.\n\nEven with the stipend I get from the school for the teaching assistant job, with the money I'm raising from selling peanuts and snacks, I managed to get my sisters married and I was able slowely pay off my debts that I aquired during their wedding.\n\nMy brother that sold peanuts along side of me is now an MA, MPhil PEd graduate and is a teacher at a local government school (Translators comment: working at a government school carries benefits such as pension and health. It is considered a desired job in India.)\n\nMy other brother, Balamurugan is now selling clothes at a train-station platform and making a living.\n\nIf you have desire and determination - realize that in our society we have folks that can support and encourage us to move us forward. And this is what I have realized.\n\nStarting from the folks that bought my peanuts, my teachers in high school that showed me their support, my teachers in College and my friends have all encouraged me every step of the way to show me the way forward.\n\nIt is their encouragement each and every day that has propelled me towards this PhD.\" says Palaniraj with great strength and determination.\n\nTranslators comment below \n\nSo on this Thanks Giving Day 2017 - we each should encourage others in our lives that we can touch - our significant other, our children, our parents, our friends, our family, our distant relatives, our neighbors, our coworkers, our pets and our strangers that walk into our lives each and everyday. Your act of random kindness and encouragement might make the key difference in someone else's life.\n\nGo out there and encourage someone in your life today! With a little bit of Encouragement and with Desire, Stength and Determination - all things are possible!\n\nCheers.\n\nblockquoteIf you find this article useful, consider signing up for my email or repost this on your favorite social site.

        "title": "15 year old teen invents device to detect a silent heart attack six hours before it occurs",
        "content": "\n\nThis article was compiled from various blog sites that discussed the invention and details of the invention developed by Akash Manoj - a fifteen year old child prodigy over a three to five year period. The objective of this blog article is to describe his achievement and to provide a scientific detail around his invention (which I found lacking in other articles on-line). I felt that by providing the foundation and a road-map on how he devised the solution will encourage others to follow their inner creativity and dreams to achieve their desires and goals. This is my own understanding and interpretation based on the glimpses that was shared in various articles and by no means a first-hand account.\n\n{{img src=\"/img/article/AkashManoj-Inventor.jpg\" alt=\"Akash Manoj - Teen Prodigy, Innovator and Inventor\" width=\"200\"  align=\"left\" class=\"imgframe\"}}\nAkash Manoj, a tenth grade student from Tamil Nadu, India has developed a new technique that can non-invasively detect the risk of a silent heart attack - something that can save many lives in rural areas. \n\nThe Stats: \"Silent Heart Attack\" is not only a major problem in India but all over the world. Two in one-hundred cases survive the attack and diagnosis is usually only after the attack. With no early warning or detection system in place and the costs for running such detection tests (after the heart attack) that could run up to 5000 Rs-INR ($100 USD or more) while it maybe too late. The decade old process involved either an electrocardiogram or echocardiogram [EKG] to detect the attack.\n\nThe Drive/Motivation: His grandfather dies from a silent heart attack when Akash was ten. His grandfather suffered for several years prior to the heart-attack from diabetes and high blood pressure. And one day had the silent heart attack, collapsed and died. This was the driving force that made Akash embark on a journey to create a device that could detect the \"silent heart attack\" so that precious lives could be saved.\n\nObjective/Criteria: His criteria for the sensor included:\n\n  Inexpensive\n  Rapid\n  Simple\n  Sensitive\n  Selective\n  Non-invasive\n  Portable\n  Wearable\n\nThe Video: Here is a link to the YouTube video where he explains his invention and how he came up with it:\n\nAkash Manoj talking about his invention on YouTube\n\nThe Research: Akash learnt from the Internet that during a heart attack, several hundred different unique proteins are sent out by the heart as an early-warning signal (SOS) into the blood-stream. He began a process of elimination to find the one unique protein marker that can be tracked by an external device. He determined that the FABP3 protein can be the marker that he needed to detect in quantities greater than a standard normal value. FABP3 is one of the smallest proteins that can be present in blood, and is charged negatively (so it attracted to positive charges). If a device can be constructed to attract the negatively charged particles to the surface then one could measure the quantity to deduce and detect a heart attack before it happens.\n\nThe Device:\n\n  A small silicon patch stuck to your wrist or back of your ear can be used regularly to monitor whether there has been a heart attack instead of waiting for a doctor to prescribe a test.\n  The patch uses a positively charged electrical impulse to draw negatively charged ---protein to the surface.\n  If the amount of FABP3 is high, then the person would need immediate medical attention.\n  People who are at risk are recommended to use the device twice a day -- in the morning and at night, before going to bed.\n  The product can soon be seen in the market and would cost around R 900, cheaper than a glucometer.\n\nTesting: How do you test the device and how do you calibrate it?\n\nAkash's model consists of a silicone membrane that represents the skin capillaries, and a drop of a solution of proteins albumin and FABP3 to simulate blood. He further explains that when a small potential of positive charge is applied to the model FABP3 accumulates on dermal capillaries. The same can be then detected by ultra-violet (UV) quantification.\n\nultra-violet (UV) quantification explained:\n{{img src=\"/img/article/Lightdispersionconceptual_waves.gif\" alt=\"Light Dispersion\" width=\"250\"  align=\"left\" class=\"imgframe\"}}Light is made up of positively charged particles or photons. Most molecules in nature absorb the photons in various quantities which are present in the ultra-violet light or visible spectrum of light. When you sit under the sun, during exposure to sunlight, 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin absorbs UV radiation and is converted to previtamin D3 which in turn isomerizes into vitamin D3. (don't worry if it sounds too complicated). Putting it in layman terms, when you sit under the sun, the 7-dehydrocholesterol proteins absorb the photons from sunlight (because they are negatively charged) and convert them to vitamin-D. Visible Light and UV light is composed of a broad spectrum of wavelengths. Different wavelengths show up as different bands of colored light on a spectrum. Remember the experiment where light is shot through a prism and when projected on a wall shows up with all the colors of the rainbow. Each color in the rainbow represents a different wavelength of light. The more excited the photons the closer to the red-spectrum. The more cooler (less excited photons), they register as blue light. \n\n{{img src=\"/img/article/visible-spectrum.jpg\" alt=\"Visible Light Spectrum\" height=\"250\"  align=\"right\" class=\"imgframe\"}} \nEach protein responds differently to the different wavelengths of light. Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1760, noted that the absorbance of a material sample is directly proportional to it's thickness (path length). In 1852, August Beers discovered that the absorbance of light is proportional to the concentration of the attenuating species in the material sample. The modern derivation of the Beer-Lambert law combines the two laws and correlates the absorbance to both the concentrations of the attenuating species as well as the thickness of the material sample. Since different molecule absorbs radiation (light) at different wavelengths. An absorption spectrum will show a number of absorption bands corresponding to structural groups within the molecule. By measuring the difference in radiation/light from what was transmitted to what was measured leaving the sample one can deduce the amount of radiation that was absorbed by the sample. Or in other words, imagine an orange light entering the medium and comes out blue. Now by looking at the change in color of the out-coming light you can detect high concentrations of a certain particles in the medium. So by analyzing how a certain color of light changes its color when reflected back with the high concentrations of FABP3 proteins, once can then formulate the presence or absence of high concentrations of the FABP3 protein in the medium. Now all of this sounds very simple but it's still a needle in a haystack when you look at different shades of the same color and that is where a spectroscope or spectrometer comes into play. Both a spectroscope and spectrometer work similar where light is separated into light bands/particles to indicate the intensity of the light as a function of wavelength.\n\n{{img src=\"/img/article/DoOneThingThatScaresYou.jpg\" alt=\"Do One Thing Every Day That Scares You - by - Eleanor Roosevelt\" width=\"250\"  align=\"left\" class=\"imgframe\"}} So putting all of this together, when the heart produces SOS signals by flooding the bloodstream with various proteins, the FABP3 protein being one of the smallest protein escapes in small quantities all the way through the skin capillaries (almost like sweat on the skin). The presence of high-concentrations of FABP3 on the surface is registered by the patch which measures the change in the wavelength (and this is the secret sauce). When enough quantities are noticed, the unit triggers an indicator warning the user of an eminent \"silent\" heart-attack. Thereby saving countless lives.\n\nAnd when you read his comments on all the blogs where he is mentioned, his key driver was \"encouragement\" (encouragement provided by his family, his friends, his teachers, etc.) See my previous article on - Life's Possibilities when fueled by Encouragement, Desire, Strength and Determination.

So to put an end to this, I've decided to add the instructions in a blog. Hopefully these instructions will be helpful others that may be in the same situation.\n\nLet's hope that the Google Search will index my site and help you find this page when needed.\n\nNOTE: Please note that this will not reset any faults on the Volvo. This procedure only resets the regular service reminder that says \"Time for regular service\".\n\nInstructions:\n\nTurn ignition key to position I. \nEnsure that the odometer is set to \"T1\" position \nPress and hold trip odometer reset button and wait until odometer goes to zero.\nTurn ignition key to run position II (not the start position) \nWait until service light begins blinking and the original mileage returns to the screen. \nRelease Trip Odometer button \nTurn ignition to off position (you should do this quickly)\n\nCheers!\n\nIf you find this content useful, please consider sharing this on your Facebook, Twitter or other Social sites.

        "content": "\n tl;dr This article shows you how to efficiently alter column data-types that leverages PostgreSQL TimeScale hyper-tables.\n\n{{img src=\"/img/2019/09/05/img_5503.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Skies Over Baltimore\" align=\"center\" class=\"imgframe\"}}\n\nDriving home from a long day of work, I see the beautiful sky and so I pull over to the side of the road to snap this picture. What a glorious sunset! But then you get back into your car and reality kicks in! :-) I was once again reminded of today's challenges. (It's funny how your mind works). And so I drive home, boot up my personal server. I try to recreate the issue and refine my process and understanding. At the end of the night, I felt that it's best to document my findings for posterity and to share it with the rest of the world in hopes that someone running into the same challenge can benefit from this knowledge. If you find this article useful, drop me a line. It will be reassuring to know that these journals that I keep, helps others along the way! ;-)\n\nLet's dive into the problem!\n\nProblem Statement\n\n{{img src=\"/img/logo/postgresql.png\" alt=\"PostgreSQL TimeScale hypertable\" align=\"left\" class=\"imgframe\"}}  When you work with PostgreSQL tables with time-series data, you may end up choosing TimeScale as a product for storing time-series data in a relational database. You other options to consider will be - a href=\"https://kairosdb.github.io/\" target=\"blank\" alt=\"kairosdb\"KairosDB/a on top of a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/\" target=\"blank\" alt=\"Cassandra - Big Data\"Cassandra/a, a href=\"https://www.influxdata.com/\" target=\"blank\" alt=\"InfluxDB\"InfluxDB/a, a href=\"https://graphiteapp.org/\" target=\"blank\" alt=\"Graphite\"Graphite/a, or to build your own using a href=\"https://hbase.apache.org/\" target=\"blank\" alt=\"HBase\"HBase/a or a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb\" target=\"blank\" alt=\"RocksDB\"RocksDB/a or a href=\"https://github.com/google/leveldb\" target=\"blank\" alt=\"LevelDB\"LevelDB/a, etc. But each option you consider has various implications on the a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPtheorem\" target=\"_blank\" alt=\"CAP Theorem\"CAP Theorem/a (WRT to Consistency/Availability/Partition Tolerance). But that's another article for a later date. Back to the story...\n\nAs your schema design evolves, you will need to modify the table-columns to support the changes. TimeScale uses hyper-tables to shard/chunk the time-series data into smaller tables that uses your time column as an index. This has a penalty when you save the data (WRITE) but has very good READ benefits. There may be cases where you need to modify a column type from one type to another. Example in this case is that you created one of the time columns as type TIMESTAMP (timestamp with no timezone data) and then realize later on that you need to convert it to TIMESTAMPZ (timestamp with timezone data).  \n\nHere is a clean way you can make that modification.\n\n WARNING: Do not attempt to drop the _hyper tables. They contain the actual data that you INSERTed into your primary table. These tables are created as child tables and the actual data is stored within the _hyper tables. \n\n Step-1: Create a temporary table that will hold the real table data\n\nprecode class=\"language-sql line-numbers\"\nCREATE TABLE tmp_SmartDiskMetrics AS\n    SELECT * FROM SmartDiskMetrics;\n\nThis creates a tmp_* table with no constraints or foreign key maps \n tmp table will be owned by the user you are currently logged in into psql    \n/code/pre\n\nStep-2: Truncate table that requires column change\n\nprecode class=\"language-sql line-numbers\"\nTRUNCATE TABLE SmartDiskMetrics;\n\n This will be free of any constraints\nWhen you run \"\\d+ SmartDiskMetrics\", your table will not have any Child table references to hyper-tables  \n/code/pre\n\n Step-3: Convert table column\n\nprecode class=\"language-sql line-numbers\"\nALTER TABLE SmartDiskMetrics ALTER COLUMN time TYPE timestamp with time zone;\nALTER TABLE SmartDiskMetrics ALTER COLUMN time SET DEFAULT now();\nALTER TABLE SmartDiskMetrics ALTER COLUMN time SET NOT NULL;\n\nWhen you run \"\\d+ SmartDiskMetrics\" now, your table schema will have \"timestamp with time zone\", not-null, now() \n/code/pre\n\n Step-4: Move back the data from tmp_ table to the real table\n\nprecode class=\"language-sql line-numbers\"\nINSERT INTO SmartDiskMetrics SELECT * FROM tmp_SmartDiskMetrics;\n\nWhen you run \"\\d+ SmartDiskMetrics\" now, your table * will have * Child table with references pointing to hyper-tables \n like timescaledbinternal.hyper1245chunk \n/code/pre\n\nThat's it! You have now modified a PostgreSQL table with time-series (with timezone) data backed by TimeScale hyper-table.\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider bookmarking, subscribing and/or sharing it on your favorite social channels so that others can also find and read these articles.

I've dealt with system and monitoring solutions that puts out over a million IoT sensor data every few minutes. Streaming them, storing them, analyzing them and finding ways to slice and dice that data has always been interesting to me. And this has built my career the past 15 years. I am constantly trying to find new ways ways to show and represent the data in an UI dashboard and to try to find interesting anomalies in the data patterns. And each time, I thought to myself that this work is complete, I always learn that the universe has a new twist and it teaches me that there are new ways to slice and dice that data than I have considered before. This could be as simple as an email newsletter broadcast with some content all the way to something as complex as displaying file system statistics in a meaningful way. But fundamentally all this slicing and dicing data ends up involving \"statistics\" in some shape or form. And that brings me to the book I'm going to talk about today!\n\nI would like to recommend a book that I've been reading lately on this topic of \"statistics\". The title of the book is \"The Cartoon Guide To Statistics\", written by Larry Gonick & Woollcott Smith. There are a series of cartoon books written by Larry Gonick and they are all equally good. Larry tries to take a complex subject and explain it in plain simple terms using cartoons as an aid. \n\nIn this book, both Larry and Woollcott begin by introducing the topic of \"what is statistics?\". They then lead the reader to \"understanding what data is all about\". They then introduce the audience to the topic of \"probability\" which then naturally leads to \"randomness\" and \"random variables\". Then they talk about \"distributions\" and \"sampling\". Then the remaining chapters talk about \"testing\", \"experimental design\" techniques and \"regression\".\n\nOverall the approach the authors took to graphically explain complex problems was very good. Their reach into associating how history evolved the field of statistics was welcoming (such as the aristocrats gambling which led to the growth of probability theory). You also get a glimpse on characters like - the Roman Emperor, Claudius and his book \"How to win at dice?\", the renaissance, Chevalier De Mere that questioned the rolling of the dice and the outcomes which eventually led to Blaise Pascal and Pierre De Fermat coming up with the \"theory of probability\". \n\nOverall they took a dry subject and made it fun to read on a Saturday afternoon. [A little glass of wine (and some great weather) helps you along the way as well.]\n\nHere is a sample of one of my favorite cartoons from the book on the topic of \"Statistical Inferences\":\n\n{{img src=\"/img/2019/09/07/SeatOfMyPants.jpg\" alt=\"Seat of my pants\" width=\"400\" align=\"center\" class=\"imgframe\"}}\n\nIn summary, I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to learn about Statistics in a fun way.

        "content": "\n tl;dr COVID-19 has impacted all of us in some shape or form. The time to rebuild America (and the World) starts today with each and every one of us. It is time to wake the sleeping giant in each and everyone of us and do our part in this RECOVER - REBOOT - REBUILD process.\n\n{{img src=\"/img/2020/04/10/covid-19_2Rs.png\" alt=\"COVID-19 : RECOVER, REBOOT, REBUILD\" width=\"250\" align=\"left\" class=\"alignleft round-img-border imgframe-right-pad\"}}\n\nToday, (as I reflect on the pandemic) I am constantly reminded that we are yet to see the peak of this impact; with no end at sight, no light at the end of the tunnel, no reason yet to celebrate. My mind goes through a flood of emotions, thoughts, memories, visuals, events and sounds as I am continuously reminded of the ghostly silent voices of the dead. The casualties of this war where the enemy isn't a faceless soldier from afar but someone very near and close to us. A self-inflicted wound. A child and product of our own upbringing! Our own harvest and reaping! This article is my attempt to capture it all and to find some solace and grace through it all. \n\nHow it all began (for me)?\n\nDuring the middle of January 2020, I began hearing stories of this COVID-19 virus that's spreading through Wuhan, China. Prior to that I have never heard of Wuhan province in China or it's popular wildlife marketplace. But today (on April 10th, 2020 as I write this), I don't think there would a person on earth who has not heard of Wuhan, China or it's wildlife marketplace. From January to today the disease has spread like wild-fire across the world, infecting over 1.6 million people, killing over 100,000+ people and the numbers are only growing exponentially with each day. We are yet to see the \"flattening of the curve\" as the experts call it.\n\n How America (and the World) is coping with this pandemic?\n\nAs scientists around the world are desperately trying to find ways to prevent or reduce the spread of this virus. Social workers, doctors, nurses, medical professionals around the world (especially in places like New York, Italy, UK and Europe) are working double and triple shifts to help the onslaught of this virus. What they are able to provide is comfort medicine in most cases because unless the body is able to fight this invisible killer there is no hope. The urban landscapes of yesterday's busy world have become the battleground of a new war where the enemy remains elusive and hidden from sight. We see the devastation in the after-math trail of death it leaves behind. It is truly a war that nobody anticipated or prepared.\n\nThe Impact\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/2020/04/10/crossroads.jpg\" caption=\"Uncertain Future\" width=\"450\" class=\"alignright round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\nAs we all try to cope with this - terms such as \"social distancing\" and \"work from home (WFH)\" have become our everyday vocabulary. The world economy has been going through an economic crisis. From a childhood, our generation always imagined that the next World War III will happen over an Armageddon battle with nuclear weapons by the world super-powers blowing each other away into smithereens with weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) but nature had a different plan instead. For all the abuse and neglect we have given her over the generations, she comes back with a vengeance in a tiny invisible package to teach all of us a lesson in humility and how feeble, fragile and delicate our human existence really is on this planet. She reminds us that what we take for granted as OURS and MINE are really not ours for the taking but a gift granted by her upon the frail humanity.\n\nThe Native Americans and our great ancestors that once lived in harmony with nature took what was needed for their essential needs, their daily sustenance and paid their respects and she honored them and gave back in abundance. Somewhere along the journey, we have forgotten our place to live in harmony with nature and instead of engaging in mutual respect, reciprocity and caring for the natural environment - we replaced it with greed, lust, arrogant exuberance and overindulgence. Our sandwiches are always super-sized along with the soda. Not to mention the big houses, big cars with all the vanity to out-do each other. All this indulgence and greed comes at a price of exploiting mother nature. We deforested land the size of countries for usable land. We used pesticides to create better, greater harvests to feed the world. But in the process, we have polluted our land, our streams, our rivers and our oceans. In the name of building our economy, we built cities and factories that spans the globe and touch the sky only to fill it with more hungry people. In the name of opportunity, we built and fueled the automobiles and cities with oil from underground to allow every family to own two or more cars only to add more smog, more pollution, and more greenhouse gases into the beautiful skies. We consumed everything in our path and produced more waste than any other species on earth. All to what benefit? Have we really made humanity perfect or better? Although human lifespan has increased, we have also seen an increase in cancer and other heath debilitating diseases. We have built rockets that can take humanity to the stars and yet we haven't solved the fundamental issues that haunt us daily such as hunger and equal rights among our fellow human-beings. Man shoot for the stars but he has failed to understand even a drop of water in it's entirety. \n\nWhen the first atom bomb was detonated, J. Robert Oppenheimer (a leading scientist on the Manhattan 'atom bomb' Project) quoted a verse from the sacred Hindu scripture Sri Bhagavad Gita: \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds\" after seeing the devastation that an atom bomb can bring. But today, that term can be rightfully applied to all of humanity where we have become the Death and the destroyer of the worlds. And now it's Mother Nature's turn to reclaim what is rightfully hers and to remind each of us that we are all dust in the sands of time. She once again reminds us that after all of humanity is gone, she will still remain supreme. \n\n So where do we go from here and how can I help?\n\nSomeday in the near future, either the entire population would have gone through the COVID-19 leaving behind it's survivors and/or a breakthrough in medicine will allow some of the population of the uninfected to remain safe. And as humans, we will all have to pick up the pieces and recover, reboot and rebuild our lives. But we don't have to wait for that day to come landing in our laps. We can start today and do our part in the rebuilding effort. \n\nWe can start by addressing the needs of the poor and the hungry today. Did you know that one in nine people on earth do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life? That's 795 million people in the world or 12.9 percent of the World population. And with the recent displacement due to wars, famine, political unrest and not to mention the biggest factor - COVID-19, that number has grown significantly in the recent days. The demand to provide for a simple meal for the poor, the hungry and the needy has become difficult at local food banks. The need for basic necessities have increased due to the high unemployment rates and joblessness in America and around the world. The restaurants that used to provide the left over surplus meals are shutdown. And this has increased the demand for food.\n\nSo to start, you can make a difference in someones life by contributing and donating towards a local food bank or shelter near you. If you live in America, find a local food bank near you or visit a href='https://www.feedingamerica.org' target='blank' alt='FeedingAmerica.org'FeedingAmerica.org/a. If you live at some other part of the world, contribute to organizations like a href='https://www.unicef.org/' target='blank' alt='unicef.org'UNICEF/a or the a href='https://www.redcross.org' target='_blank' alt='redcross.org'Redcross/a. Help feed a hungry person today! I did and that is what gave me this inspiration to write this article in hopes that I can convince one more soul to donate now! So stop here and make a donation and return back to continue reading this article. :-) \n\n Food Banks across America are experiencing more than usual high volume and food shortages due to COVID-19 and unemployment. You can make a difference. Find a Food Bank local to your area and consider making a contribution.\n\nhr\na href='https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank' target='_blank' class='mtp-align-center'img src='/img/2020/04/10/FindAFoodBankNearYou.png' alt='Search for a Food Bank Near You'//a\nhr \n\n ### The future is in our hands\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/2020/04/10/future-is-here.jpg\" caption=\"Future is Here and Now\" width=\"450\" class=\" alignleft round-img-border imgframe-right-pad\" }}\nAt this juncture (as I write this article), I'm reminded of a moment from my past in a Hindu wedding ceremony where the bride and groom walk around a sacred fire and with each step signifying an oath, promise and commitment to each other. Today, we each need to take an oath, promise and commitment to help build a better version of each of us and humanity. \n\nAnd with that I have come up with our own ten steps that we can take to build a better tomorrow. So here we go:\n\nLet us take our first step towards rebuilding our families in our homes, our streets and our neighborhoods to help reduce poverty and hunger. Let no man, woman, child or other sentient being go hungry ever!\nLet us take our second step towards educating our children so that they can learn to live in harmony with nature. Teach them our mistakes and trespassing so that they can have a fighting chance at building a brighter future!\nLet us take our third step towards restructuring our lives, our jobs and our careers so that we use less of the natural resources including time, water, fuel, harvested energy, product consumption and consumerism. Let us invest towards a brighter future in finding new innovative solutions for renewable, carbon neutral or carbon negative energy sources that are common and available to all of humanity and the world!\nLet us take our fourth step towards eating healthy fruits, vegetables and grains that are grown locally using natural methods of harvesting and sustainable agriculture. The land and nature knows what we need and it will nourish our health with our needs! \nLet us take our fifth step towards adopting a naturally friendly alternative farming practices to move us away from an unsustainable meat and poultry industry, from  genetically modified food sources to farming that is friendly to the natural environment. Give a portion of the land back to nature and reforestation!\nLet us take our sixth step towards taking time each day to connect with our inner self and to grow spiritually while respecting each others differences. It is our differences and diversity in thought and action that makes us unique, strong and resilient as we forge a new humanity!\nLet us take our seventh step towards taking care of our individual health each and every day and support career practices and goals that leads us to a healthier life and work balance!\nLet us take our eighth step towards taking time each day to appreciate nature, to respect one another and to respect all sentient life in all of it's beauty and glory!\nLet us take our ninth step to give thanks to our fellow brothers and sisters that have taken this journey alongside to recover, reboot and rebuild this planet. Together we can build a better world for ourselves, our children, our children's children and for all the sentient beings that depend on our love and respect!\nLet us take our tenth step to love yourself because there is no beauty in life without YOU at the heart of it. You are unique with infinite potential and infinite possibilities - make it happen!\n\nSo I hope you will take the ten steps with me and if these ten steps don't work for you then find your own tune but start the dance now! Don't wait for tomorrow! This is the time to RECOVER, REBOOT, REBUILD! Take that first step with me!\n\n(In memory of all the fallen soldiers, mothers, fathers, children, social-workers, health-care professionals, doctors, nurses and all of humanity that have dedicated and sacrificed their lives so that we may live to tell the tale!)\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider bookmarking, subscribing and/or sharing it on your favorite social channels so that others can also find and read these articles.

        "content": "\n tl;dr Easiest way to find out your Windows 10 Product Key for reinstallation or reimaging your computer. As an added bonus, I'll talk about two tips on how you can upgrade your computers hardware to give it a second life.\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/logo/windows10.png\" caption=\"\" width=\"150\" class=\"alignleft round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\n\nLately for adults, \"work from home\" (WFH) has become the new norm and with kids attending classes online - having a good, clean setup of your laptop or computer has become a necessity. And so a lot of folks are trying to reinstall Windows onto their computers and get rid of all the malware and spam window pop-ups to give it a fresh start. Or you may be trying to take inventory of your system to know which computer or laptop has a certain Windows license applied. In either case, the first step is to inventory your current setup to find out the Windows 10 product key so that you can use the same key to reinstall. This will save you some money from having to buy another license of Windows when you already have a licensed version tied to your computer.\n\nIf you are trying to install a fresh copy of Windows 10, you can download the ISO image here from Microsoft:\na href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10\" target=\"_blank\"Windows 10 ISO/a\n\nSince this article is not about Windows 10 reinstall, we'll stick to our goal which is to identify the Product Key. Finding the Windows Product Key is not straight forward. With earlier versions of Windows, the OEM manufactures affixed the Product Key sticker on the back of the computer. This led to hackers stealing Product Key by simply taking a photograph of your affixed sticker and selling it online. To prevent this, a lot of OEM manufacturers stopped affixing the Product Key stickers and instead placed the Windows Product Key inside the BIOS registry. And you just need a tool that can read it and provide you with the key. If you Google it you may find all sorts of hacks and things to download and try out. And a lot of them end up putting additional Malware onto your computer and so you need a trusted source for such a tool.\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/2020/04/19/Windows-10-Enter-a-product-key.png\" caption=\"Windows 10 Prompt for entering your Product Key\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border\" }}\n\nMy recommendation is NirSoft's Product Key Tool available here:\na href=\"https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/productcdkeyviewer.html\" target=\"blank\"NirSoft Produkey/a Utility.\n\nNote: When you download the tool, most virus scanners classify this tool as Malware and they may quarantine it immediately. I feel that this tool should be in your systems toolkit. I assure you that there is no virus or malware or trojan that's bundled along with the tools. I have used NirSoft's tools for over many, many years and also check out this link from NirSoft site letting you know it's legit. You may need to whitelist this download so that you can unzip and extract the contents (including the executable). The other tools I highly recommend for your toolbox can be found at the end of this article under \"Recommended tools for your toolbox\" section.\n\nAfter you extract and you can run \"ProduKey\" executable and it will produce an output similar to the screen-shot below:\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/2020/04/19/nirsoft.png\" caption=\"NirSoft ProduKey Screenshot displaying the Windows 10 Product Key(s)\" width=\"1024\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border\" }}\n\nAs you can see from the image above, I had a BIOS OEM Key that came with my Dell Laptop but unfortunately I didn't have this utility handy with me back then and so I dropped a new version of my purchased Windows 10. The next time, I reimage this laptop, I will switch back to the OEM Product Key and use my spare Windows license somewhere else.\n\nIt will also be beneficial to create a \"PID.txt\" file with the Product Key in \"C:\\\" (root of your C-Drive) so that when you reinstall Windows 10, the installation process will look for the file and read in the Product Key saving you a step in the process. The contents of the PID.txt file needs to adhere to the following format:\n\nprecode class=\"language-bash line-numbers\"[PID]\nValue=XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX\n/code/pre\nwhere XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX is the product key.\n\nBefore we end this article, I would like to provide you with a few tips to consider when you upgrade your hardware.\n\nTips on upgrading your hardware\n\n Add more memory to your system (approx. cost : $30-$40 for two-DIMM3 sticks)\nUse the HWiNFO tool (listed below) to determine your current memory capacity used.\nThen use a href=\"https://www.crucial.com/store/advisor\" target=\"_blank\"Crucial's Upgrade Advisor Online Tool/a to determine the maximum supported memory and type (DIMM3 vs DIMM2, etc) for your system. \nYou can then shop around online/at store at places like Amazon, MicroCenter, BestBuy, Office Depot, Staples to buy your additional memory.\n\nThis will give you the first improvement (and second life) to your system.\n\nSwap out your spinning harddrive to a SSD harddrive (approx. cost : $45-$85 for middle-grade SSD from Samsung)\nAgain use the HWiNFO tool (listed below) to determine if you have SATA3 (or greater) support and you can order a SSD (or hybrid harddrive).\nYou can then shop around online/at store at places like Amazon, MicroCenter, BestBuy, Office Depot, Staples to buy your SSD harddrive. note: There is no need to get a SSD that is identical in size. As long as the new SSD is same or greater in capacity will work.\nRecommendation:\na href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0781Z7Y3S/ref=cmswemr_mtdpU_gIiNEbHMWTCWV\" target=\"blank\"Samsung 860 EVO 500GB 2.5 Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-76E500B/AM) from Amazon.com/a (not an affiliate and I don't get paid for recommending). Typically runs at around $85.\n\nTo swap out your drive, I would recommend this drive cloner tool from a href=\"https://www.wavlink.com/enus/product/ST334UC.html\" target=\"blank\"WavLink/a (available at Walmart or Amazon for about $30) (Please note that this made in China product lacks good instructions but works awesome and saves you a good deal of money. Follow this a href=\"https://youtu.be/DhvIdwzu9Hw\" target=\"_blank\"YT video/a for how to use it.) Here are my notes on the instructions:\nPress and hold the offline clone button for 3 seconds, the LED indicator will light up. Then quickly press the offline clone button once again immediately and the offline clone operation will start. Each LED represents 25% completion. It is only when every 25% of HDD A is offline clone to HDD B that such LED will remain constantly on. When offline clone operation is fully completed, all LEDs will constant on until the device is power off.\nAt this point, your primary drive (typically C Drive) will be identically cloned and now it will be a matter of swapping them out. \nNote: When you boot up Windows for the first time, you will see an \"Unexpected Store Exception\". This is normal. Simply reboot your computer once again and it will boot back into Windows without the error.\n\nHopefully with the above two upgrades, you will be able to extend the life of your computer for another few years.\n\n Recommended tools for your toolbox\nNirSoft ProduKey\na href=\"https://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd\" target=\"_blank\"Hiren's Boot CD/a\nAnother version created by Hiren's fans a href=\"https://www.hirensbootcd.org/\" target=\"_blank\"here/a\na href=\"https://www.hwinfo.com/download/\" target=\"_blank\"HwiNFO/a shows your hardware setup so that you can determine if you have SATA3 support to upgrade your hard drive to a faster SSD hard drive. \n\nIf you find this article useful, consider bookmarking, subscribing and/or sharing it on your favorite social channels so that others can also find and read these articles.

        "content": "\n tl;dr Sometimes when we need to debug functions in Python, we need a way to write some quick timer code to capture the time-delta and to compute the time it took for the function to execute. This article shows you a quick and easy way to humanize a time-interval/time-delta without bringing in additional dependencies or libraries like Arrow or Humanize.\n\nprecode class=\"language-python\"Elapsed Time: 2 Days, 5 Hours, 7 Minutes, 13 Seconds \n/code/pre \n\n{{figure src=\"/img/2020/05/unsplash1.jpg\" caption=\"Yucel Moral (@yucelmoran) at Unsplash\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/logo/python_logo.png\" caption=\"\" width=\"120\" class=\"alignleft round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\n\nSometimes when we need to debug functions in Python, we need a way to write some quick timer code to capture the time-delta and to compute the time it took for the function to execute. As an example:\n\nprecode class=\"language-python line-numbers\"from datetime import datetime \nstart = datetime.now()\nThen call some long running code or function here\nend = datetime.now()\ndiff = end - start\nprint diff\n/code/pre  \n\nAnd this gives you:\n\nprecode class=\"language-python line-numbers\"print diff\n123 days, 16:48:22\n/code/pre\n\nNow the variable \"diff\" holds a value of type: timedelta (elapsed-time or time-interval in seconds) as shown with the Python type() function below:\n\nprecode class=\"language-python line-numbers\"print type(diff)\n&lt;class 'datetime.timedelta'&gt;\n/code/pre\n\nTo get it formatted into a human-readable friendly format, you can bring in a library such as a href=\"https://arrow.readthedocs.io/\" target=\"blank\"Arrow/a or a href=\"https://github.com/jmoiron/humanize\" target=\"blank\"Humanize/a. There is nothing wrong with these libraries. In fact, they are two great libraries that I use frequently. But sometimes, you just need to display the time-interval or time-delta in a human readable format without brining in an additional library into the mix to display \"Elapsed Time\" in a friendly format like this:\n\nprecode class=\"language-python\"Elapsed Time: 2 Days, 5 Hours, 7 Minutes, 13 Seconds \n/code/pre\n\nThe snippet below will get you the results you need:\n\nprecode class=\"language-python\"days = diff.days  Get Day \nhours,remainder = divmod(diff.seconds,3600) # Get Hour\nminutes,seconds = divmod(remainder,60) # Get Minute & Second\n\nprint(f'Elapsed Time: {days} Days, {hours} Hours, {minutes} Minutes, {seconds} Seconds.') \n/code/pre\n\nSample Output:\nprecode class=\"language-python\"Elapsed Time: 2 Days, 5 Hours, 7 Minutes, 13 Seconds \n/code/pre\n\nhr\nbFull Working Example:/b\nprecode class=\"language-python\"from datetime import datetime \nstart = datetime.now()\nThen call some long running code or function here\nend = datetime.now()\ndiff = end - start\nprint type(diff)\nprint diff\ndays = diff.days  Get Day \nhours,remainder = divmod(diff.seconds,3600) # Get Hour\nminutes,seconds = divmod(remainder,60) # Get Minute & Second\n\nprint(f'Elapsed Time: {days} Days, {hours} Hours, {minutes} Minutes, {seconds} Seconds.') \n/code/pre\nhr\n\nThe trick to this example/implementation is to use the a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod\" target=\"_blank\"divmod/a function in Python. The divmod() function in python takes two numbers and returns a pair of numbers (tuple) consisting of their quotient and remainder.\n\nSyntax:\nprecode class=\"language-python\"divmod(x, y)\nx and y : x is numerator and y is denominator\nx and y must be non complex\nReturns tuple (quotient, remainder)\n/code/pre\n\nExamples:\nprecode class=\"language-python\"Input: x = 9, y = 3\nOutput: (3, 0)\n3 is quotient, 0 is remainder\nInput: x = 16, y = 3\nOutput:(5, 1)\n 5 is quotient, 1 is remainder\n/code/pre\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider bookmarking, subscribing and/or sharing it on your favorite social channels so that others can also find and read these articles.

Exclude the tests from coverage.\n  By default, Coverage will include all the \"init.py\" files that marks the folder as a module to Python. These files are always 100%. Why include them in the report. Adds too much noise. Omit them from the report.\nSometimes your debug code like print(f'Full Name: {person.name}') maybe enclosed in a \"if DEBUG:\" clause, and that particular branch does not serve any useful purpose other than debugging the variables. You don't need to cover them in your tests. To avoid this use \"# pragma: no cover\" (see a href=\"https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/excluding.html\" target=\"_blank\"this link/a for more details)\n  In your production code use effective \"a href=\"https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/excluding.html\" target=\"_blank\"# pragma: no cover/a\" to denote areas which you don't want to include in your coverage. \n  If you have a block of code (multiple lines) that you want to exclude, you don't want to add \"# pragma: no cover\" to every line, use something like:\n\nprecode class=\"language-python line-numbers\"  if True: # pragma: no cover\n\t  print('Line1')\n\t  print('Line2')\n\t  print('Line3')\n/code/pre\n\nThe above sample will ignore all four lines from the coverage while the code is syntactically the same without the \"if True:\" (from the Python Compilers point-of-view. That's another future article. But for now, if you want to learn more about Python ByteCode, check out a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#dis' target='blank'dis/a [stands for \"disassembler\"] - or a href='https://akaptur.com/blog/2013/08/14/python-bytecode-fun-with-dis/' target='blank'here/a.)\n\nImportant Rule\n\nUsing the tips above, you'll be tempted to go globally and remove all code from coverage to reach that 100%. Don't do that. By doing so, you will pay back later when your code is missing real coverage and the issue creeps in production. So find your right balance between writing unit tests and coverage.\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider bookmarking, subscribing and/or sharing it on your favorite social channels so that others can also find and read these articles.

The idea of a a href='devops95.com' target='blank'DevOps95/a grew out of the series of towns and suburbs connecting on the interstate I-95 route on East-Coast. It is an one-day virtual meet-up (on Zoom) where industry leaders from GitOps and DevOps shared their knowledge with others. This was my first DevOps meeting with the Columbia, Maryland DevOps group (Burak T. - Thanks for sharing this event with me). It was a very educational event. The complete event lasted over 12+ hours with various presenters. You can view the complete 12-hour event a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3le3CSv9xQ' target='blank'here/a on YouTube. \n\nGetting Started With Kubernetes by Tiffany Jernigan \n\n{{figure src=\"/img/logo/kubernetes-1.png\" caption=\"\" width=\"120\" class=\"alignleft round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\n\nI was lucky enough to attended the a href='https://www.meetup.com/devops-columbia/' target='blank'DevOps Columbia, Maryland Meetup/a portion of the online event where a href='https://twitter.com/tiffanyfayj' target='blank'Tiffany Jernigan/a (Senior Developer Advocate from a href='https://www.vmware.com/' target='_blank'VMware/a) gave a talk on \"Getting Started with Kubernetes\". \n\nSince I enjoyed this tech-talk, I felt that it will benefit others looking into Kubernetes. I clipped just the portion of the \"Getting Started with Kubernetes\" tech-talk (approximately 1.2 hrs. long) from the 12-hour segment and posted it on YouTube with relevant links back to the presenter. The credit for this goes to Tiffany and the Columbia DevOps/DevOps95 group. I am essentially facilitating by shortening the video. Additionally, as I was reviewing the tech-talk I created the mind-maps for this segment. The mind-maps should help the busy folks (and for developers that prefer something to follow along as Tiffany steps you through the details. The mind-map is available both in PDF and PNG file for easy consumption.)\n\nIf you can spare about 1hr and 20 minutes, it will be well worth your time in learning the basics on how Kubernetes works and the various components. Let's go to the video.\n\n{{ youtube wX6m6G5CMSI }}\n\nbr\n\n----\n\nDetails on Presenter and Useful Links:\n\n----\n\n Presented by: Tiffany Jernigan, Senior Developer Advocate at VMware (a href='https://twitter.com/tiffanyfayj' target='_bank'@tiffanyfayj/a)br\n Presented Date: Thu, Jun 11th, 2020br\n Slide deck for this presentation: a href='https://speakerdeck.com/tiffanyfay/getting-started-with-kubernetes-2020-6-11' target='_blank'PowerPoint Slide Deck/abr\n Mind-Map of this presentation:br\n - Mind-Map As a href='https://github.com/vguhesan/mindmaps/raw/master/k8s-tiffanyfayj/GettingStartedWithKubernetes.pdf' target='_blank'PDF/a\n - Mind-Map As a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vguhesan/mindmaps/master/k8s-tiffanyfayj/GettingStartedWithKubernetes.png' target='_blank'PNG/a\n\n For DevOps95 event visit: a href='http://DevOps95.com/' target='_blank'DevOps95.com/abr\n\n This segment of the event is hosted/presented by the DevOps Columbia group.br\n You can visit our meetup at a href='https://www.meetup.com/devops-columbia/' target='_blank'DevOps-Columbia/a for upcoming events in your area.br\n I am only facilitating with the trimming the 12 hr. video series into manageable consumable parts in hope that it will benefit others along the way.br\n Complete 12 hr. video series can be located here: a href='https://youtu.be/A3le3CSv9xQ' target='_blank'DevOps95-June 2020 Full 12 hr.

And so I began writing this article as my way to compile the list of things I have learnt over the years and to distill them into an article.\n\n Lesson 1 - Learn to Adapt\n\n Life is a Journey (with no short-cuts) - Adapt or Perish (Unknown)\n\nIn the Eastern philosophy, it is believed that life is a process through which the soul matures and transcends to higher levels of understanding much like a tree. They say that to learn life, watch a tree through it's seasons. \n\nFirst, new leaves come out in spring to catch the rays and collect the energy from the sun.\nthen it moves onto making flowers (each tree produces a unique flower and scent to attract a certain type of bee or insect) to help get diversity.\nIt then creates fruits in a wide variety of colors, taste and sweetness to attract a particular type of birds and animals that would eat the fruits and help the seeds to be dropped further away from the source to help pass on the next generation and diversity.\nIt then moves into the next cycle of shedding it's leaves to shift the energy collection to the roots for the winter season when the sun is less visible.\n\nJust as the tree adapts and shifts it's course through the seasons (and it's life), as consultants, we must also adapt to the growing needs of our customer.\n\nAs the needs change, we need to be able to learn new skills, forge new opportunities and adapt to the demands.\n\nLesson 2 - Know Your Potential\n\n Learn That Within You Is An Infinite Reservoir of Infinite Possibilities At Each And Every Moment! (Unknown)\n\nWhenever you are down (or feeling miserable) think of the first caveman that created the first fire by striking two rocks and seeing the spark. And understand that it was that simple spark that led to everything you see today all the way down to the quantum computers, language, tool making and the beautiful poems by Rumi. If that caveman had given up on that day, imagine the loss to humanity today! So when you feel down in the valley, all you have to do is take a small step (and another step and so on) to infinite possibilities! Remember That Life Gives You A U-Turn At Every Moment! So start today and build your tapestry of Life!\n\n Lesson 3 - Make Yourself Known\n\n A Crying Baby Gets The Milk (Unknown)\n\n If you don't ask, you won't get (Steve Jobs)\n\n Advertise, Advertise, Advertise! Be Action-Oriented and Don't Let The Naysayers Get To You. (Arnold Schwarzenegger)\n\n(This is an excerpt from one of his College speeches) The difference between Mr.Universe and the another guy that trained at the same gym  \n",

As a good practice, it's best to consider optimizations during development to avoid edge cases that might creep up in production.\n\nImagine a scenario where your copy file has been working flawlessly until one fine day when a 5GB file is thrown at it to be copied from one location to another. If memory is a problem, then it will throw a out-of-memory and crash.\n \n\n Now the complete example \n\npre id=\"codeblkA\" class=\"line-numbers\" data-line=\"37\"code class=\"lang-go\"package main\n\nimport (\n\t\"bufio\"\n\t\"io\"\n\t\"os\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Objective: Copy contents of FileA to FileB\n\t// Perform this step in chuncks instead of using the\n\t// built-in copy functionality.\n\t// Why?\n\t// Illustrates how to use bufio library with a reader and writer\n\n\t// Source\n\tinFile, err := os.Open(\"./source-file.txt\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer inFile.Close()\n\n\t// Target\n\toutFile, err := os.Create(\"./target-file.txt\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer outFile.Close()\n\n\t// Read a bit then write a bit -- repeat until EOF\n\treader := bufio.NewReader(inFile)\n\twriter := bufio.NewWriter(outFile)\n\tfor {\n\t\tif slice, err := reader.ReadSlice('\\n'); err == nil || err == io.EOF {\n\t\t\twriter.Write(slice)\n\t\t\t// IMPORTANT: Invoke flush()\n\t\t\twriter.Flush()\n\t\t\tif err == io.EOF {\n\t\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n}\n\n/code/pre\n\nDeeper analysis\n\nul\n\tlia href=\"codeblkA.17-20\"In lines 17-20/a, we Open() the source and panic if we have a file error./li\n\tlia href=\"#codeblkA.21\"In line 21/a, we defer closing the file when we exit that function.

        "content": "\nUpdates:\n\nCompiled a series of q&a asked by blog readers over the year in hopes that my answers help others. The questions and answers are at the bottom of this article.\n\nhr\n\n{{figure src=\"img/tm-banner3.jpg\" width=\"640\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\n\nWhat is this article about?\n\nThere is an Eastern philosophy that summarizes the importance of time management. And it goes something link this:\n\nblockquote\nHow we spend our day is how we spend our lives.\n/blockquote\n\nand another philosophy that summarizes the value of time\n\nblockquote\nEvery morning we are given a new gift of 24 hours, how we use this gift wisely - shapes us, transforms us, molds us and helps forge a path towards our destiny. This process ends up being our journey.\n/blockquote\n\nI hope I've convinced you the value of time and why we want to make use of it effectively. \n\nIf you've come here looking for a new method or process to manage your time (along with some templates), then you've come to the right place. You are welcome to try out my system and see if it works for you. And the templates are completely free at no cost to you!\n\n My Journey\n\nOver the years, I have tried out many systems, techniques, templates, philosophies and understandings on effective time-management. I don't want to name them all here because the books alone can fill a wall. I do not claim to be a master of any particular system. I am always refining and perfecting my art to this day. I will share what I use as my system and you are free to take what is useful and leave behind what does not work for you. \n\nIf you are anxious to get to the templates skip to the bottom of the page to download them. But if you're interested in how to use them then it might be worth the read.\n\nThe system and why it did not work for me\n\nRather than going through my failures, let me share the system that I use today:\n\nAt this juncture, a few months ago I came across a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/10/14/my-new-planner-the-time-block-academy/\" target=\"_blank\"Cal Newport's Time-Block Planner/a technique and I tried his method. It does work but over the months I have improvised and added additional changes to the template to make it work for me. \n\nHere are my challenges with this technique:\n\nMy typical work day consisted of 12-hrs and so I needed a bit more room for the daily time-block template.\nI am a minimalist at heart. I don't think to carry a bag full of junk to manage my day. (although I end up carrying more junk for other reasons. Let's not get into it now). With the book format, I felt that I will be carrying a lot of baggage on daily basis. Not to mention the cost to refill from Cal Newport's system ($22.50 on Amazon for approx. 3.5 months of a planner - little pricey for my taste.)\nIn his technique, he starts out with the premise that you time-block and plan your day before you use any devices such as computer or phone. For me, my planning details come from multiple sources. I have an secure office computer where my external meetings for that day come in. (I cannot access them from my home computer). I have a personal computer where my volunteer and personal, family activities, appointments comes from. I also have my evenings where I plan my continuous education and exploring new ideas and projects. So I need to incorporate from all of my sources to compile a plan for the day. \nAs an engineer, I am a strong believer in the concept of a a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/ControlSystems/FeedbackLoops/\" target=\"_blank\"feedback-loop/a. And so I like to plan my next day using the time designated for \"Daily Reflection and Journal\" as well as \"Daily Metrics\". (By the way, the \"Daily Metrics\" is a great idea.)\n\n My improvised version of the Time-Block Planner Template\n\nUsing the ideas that best work for me, I have modified the templates and created my own templates shown below.\n\ntable style=\"background-color: #000; \"\n\ttr\n\t\ttd align=\"center\"{{figure src=\"/docs/Time-BlockFrontPage.jpg\" caption=\"Time-Block Planner Front Page\" width=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}/td\n\t\ttd align=\"center\"{{figure src=\"/docs/Time-BlockBackPage.jpg\" caption=\"Time-Block Planner Back Page\" width=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}/td\n\t/tr\n/table\n\n(scroll-down for the link to the templates)\n\nTemplate Synopsis\n\nTime-Block v2 : Day Scheduler\n\nReview Cal Newport's Time-Block Planner system a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/10/14/my-new-planner-the-time-block-academy/\" target=\"_blank\"here/a before you try to make sense of the template above.\nWith the first column, you can start your day at any arbitrary time each day but then stop at any arbitrary time and continue on. Examples: [6am, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 8pm, 9pm, 10pm] or [6am-6pm]\n  This allows you to arbitrarily stop during the evening time when you can't control the time for your chores with your kids or family. \n  Or you can break up the day into two work activity segments.\n  Or you can break your productivity times into multiple zones and take care of other activities in between. \nList out your daily-distractors (time-wasters) down at the bottom. I've given you room for up-to eight activities and some additional room at the \"Notes\" section below.\nI also like to see my hours spent each day and so the column in the right shows my tricking time.\n\nTime-Block v2 : Daily Summary\n\nUse the \"Daily Metrics\" section and the \"Shutdown Complete\" check-box the same way as Cal Newport describes it.\nSame with \"Tasks\" and \"Ideas\" - remember, when you have an idea or task - jot it down and move on. When you get to a point where you need to organize it or during \"reflection time\", assign those tasks and archive those ideas for a planned future or transfer it to the next day.\nUse the \"Daily Reflection/Journal\" section to note down what worked, what did not work, how to take corrective steps to better utilizing the system the next day.\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/2020/12/my-system-laid-out.jpg\" caption=\"Time-Block Planner Front Page\" width=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\n\nItems in my small folio (that I carry around)\n\nToday's Time-Block Daily Template - (two-pages, printed front and back).

Although the notebook is a bit pricey, I love the paper quality and one notebook typically lasts me for four months.

This will act as a journal. I have tabs for each month. My previous monthly items (see \"Monthly Calendar Template\" below) are also organized for the year.\nKeep in mind, the larger folio that stays home is your way to take inventory of your time and at the same time, not investing your hard earned money in some folio that was not designed with you in mind.\nPeople have asked me - why not use the bullet journal. You can - if that works for you. I've tried it and it did not work. But I do use the bullet journal for my daily note taking and meeting minutes. (I will share those samples in a future date).\n\n How to use it?\n\ntable style=\"background-color: #000; \"\n\ttr\n\t\ttd align=\"center\"{{figure src=\"/img/2020/12/sample-day-schedule-front.jpg\" caption=\"Time-Block Planner Front Page\" width=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}/td\n\t\ttd align=\"center\"{{figure src=\"/img/2020/12/sample-day-schedule-back.jpg\" caption=\"Time-Block Planner Back Page\" width=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}/td\n\t/tr\n/table\n\nCreate and get into the habit of carrying a simple folio that holds all of your day to day items for organizing yourself and the valuable time.

And I try to stick to it. When I catch myself wavering, I discipline myself to come back to the routine.\nYes, new meetings come up throughout the day. If I'm unable to move the meeting to a future date, then I simply use the next column and improvise using the techniques taught by Cal Newport in his Time-Block Planner.\nI also keep several templates for organizing my monthly goals, tracking my habits, etc.\nAt any given time, I try not to carry any additional templates except for today (front-and-back, 1 page), monthly page, habit page.\nWhen I have an idea or task that comes up, I designate it on the back page and move it at the end of the day when I reflect.\nAt the beginning of each month (typically on the last day of current month or first day of next month), I plan my monthly.\n\nThis is my current system. \n\nDownload the templates\n\nTemplates are in PDF format.

For example, what goes for each day of the month?\n\nThe a href=\"/docs/Monthly-Planner.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"Monthly Template/a is designed with three focus areas. They are as follows:\n\nCapturing important events that come up on a certain day that you don't want to miss. Birthday's, Appointments, Oil Changes, etc. (under each day). Use different colors to highlight based on importance. I use this area to examine my Google Calendar/Office-Calendar at the beginning of the month and transfer any key meetings and appointments. The underline on the left is there to write down the Day (M,Tu,W, Th,F,Sa,Su...) as reflected for that month.\n\nMonthly Goals (bottom-left), to jot down any overarching goals. Read a particular book. Learn a new art style, etc. (numbered - G1, G2, G3). These are then noted down to be done on certain days up top. Example. G1 - Read Book (The Docker Handbook). I would assign G1 every Thursday of the month so as to not overwhelm yourselves with tasks.\n\nThe right area is left open for either additional goals or as the \"feed-back loop\" (aka - reflection). Out of all the goals you set aside during the month. How much of them did you accomplish and if you did not - why? By reflecting you gain a better understanding of yourself and your demons you need to learn to slay to get back on track.\n\n(Also - if you print in a Laser Printer, it should print the dots to help guide your lines without being too distracting).\n\n Do you add things to tasks as new things come up during the day? I have been trying to do that as things come up and eventually make it to my time-block to take care of it.\n\nThis question is regarding the a href=\"/docs/Time-BlockFrontPage.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"Day Scheduler/a.\n\nIf your schedule is too rigid, then you will not follow the guide/template for more than a day (or more than a few hours) because it no longer reflects your path. So flexibility is the key. And that is why I have given you four-columns under the \"Day Scheduler\". Just replace that time slot with what took priority and shift that one appointment to a new block. Try not to reschedule the entire day because you know you will not keep up to it. I also use the last-column to the right to jot down what I really did so as to study and reflect on what happened that day. (For an example, see a href=\"/img/2020/12/my-system-laid-out.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"this image/a). \n\nIf on the other hand you find yourself needing more than four columns, it's time to reevaluate how you allow distractors to come into your day to day activities. At this point you are allowing external factors impacting your schedule too much. You need to engage in delegating your tasks to others or pushing back your distractors saying, \"I can accommodate you but not today because my plate is overwhelmed for today already. How about we meet sometime tomorrow (or down the week) at a mutually convenient time?\" (Notice my choice of words - \"at a mutually convenient time\" and not \"at a time of your convenience\").\n\nThe overarching goal of all of this exercise is to identify what I call \"distractors\" and \"time-wasters\" that robs you of your time and life! Without a daily, monthly, or yearly reflection - we are simply a leaf flowing with the ebb of the currents in a river with no course or destination in sight.\n\n How to eat an elephant? One bite at a time. :-)\n\nExample: Blog reader emailed me saying that they have added a goal to their monthly to read a book 300+ pages long.\n\nIf you set your goal to read the book - it's too wide and it will never get completed. According to James Clear in a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0593189647/\" target=\"_blank\"Atomic Habits/a. Set your goals as small as possible (bite-sized - hence \"Atomic\").\n\nSet your monthly goal to be to read chapters 1-4. And then work that over the next week into your daily schedule. When you reach that small goal, then add a secondary goal to your monthly to read chapters 5-8. This way, you are only chewing a small bite but at the end of the month (or months), you have eaten a whole elephant. (figuratively speaking). \n\nPhysiologically speaking; your mind plays tricks on you and wants to always take the easy road. The guy in your head is always talking back saying - \"watching TV, drinking a glass of wine and relaxing over a movie is always better\" over a long/big goal so you get side-tracked easily. So think ATOMIC and think DO THE ATOMIC NOW because it's easy to knock it off your list.\n\nBut as soon as you reach that ATOMIC GOAL, reward yourself with some entertainment. Make sure you check-off the item on your list so that you are emphasizing to your mind that you can do this (hand-body-mind emphasis) and then immediately jot down the next ATOMIC GOAL with the when and where and how. This is the \"secret\" on how it's done. And by repetition of this practice comes the \"Habit\" in \"Atomic Habits\". :-)\n\n I have missed doing it for 2 days and I can already notice the difficulties of not time blocking! Once work started normally, and demands on my time got more reactive, its been harder to do stuff. But I know I need to plan for reactive days as well.\n\nRemember that the templates are only as good as you use them on a daily basis. Until you make them part of your daily life, they are no good. In my case, I use them and then stop using them and then come back to them when my life's chaos indicator goes high. It goes in cycles. And all of that is part of learning! One day you will come back to this and hold it as dear as your body and then it will stick. It will become your habit! :-)\n\n Can you share a sample habit tracker?\n\n{{figure src=\"img/Habit-Tracker-Sample.png\" width=\"640\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\n\nhr\n\na href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vguhesan\" target=\"_blank\"img src=\"https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" style=\"height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;\" /a\n\nToday's Quote\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/logo/zen.png\" caption=\"\" width=\"100\" class=\"alignleft round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\nbr/\nWhen you talk, you are only repeating what you already know. br/\nBut if you listen, you may learn something new.br/\n- The Dalai Lama, XIV\n\n&nbsp;",

        "content": "\n{{figure src=\"img/unsplash.jpg\" width=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\n\nWhat is this article about?\n\nWhen you try to install VirtualBox v.6.1.30 on Windows 11, you will see the following error:\n\nblockquote\nThis app can't run on this device:\n\nThis app can't run because it causes security performance issue on Windows. A new version may be available. Check with your software provider for an updated version that runs on this version of Windows.\n/blockquote\n\n{{figure src=\"img/VirtualBoxWindowsCompatabilityError.png\" height=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\n\nIt will further prevent you from executing the installer. \n\nThis article show you how to address this issue and proceed with the VirtualBox installer.\n\n Step-1: Turn off Hyper-V on Windows-11\n\nHyper-V is an optional feature in Windows 10 that can be used to run virtual machines (VMs) and perform other virtualization duties, such as supporting Credential Guard and Windows Sandbox.\n\nTo turn off the Hyper-V, open a PowerShell (as an Administrator), and run the following:\n\nprecode class=\"language-shell line-numbers\"Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor -All\n\nDISM /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V\n\nbcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off\n\n/code/pre\n\nIMPORTANT: Shut down your computer. Wait for 10 seconds and then turn power back ON. Login back into Windows before proceeding to the next step. \n\nStep-2: Turn off Memory Integrity setting in Windows\n\nNote: Turning off the \" Memory Integrity\" setting makes your system vulnerable. But if you need VirtualBox for your Kubernetes/minikube development, then you need to temporarily turn it off.\n\nYou can also open the Core isolation page by selecting Start   Settings   Update & Security   Windows Security   Device Security and then under Core isolation, selecting Core isolation details.\n\nUnder the Core isolation page in Windows Security, turn the Memory integrity setting Off if it isn't already. You'll need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.\n\nOr follow the link a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/a-driver-can-t-load-on-this-device-8eea34e5-ff4b-16ec-870d-61a4a43b3dd5\" target=\"_blank\"here/a.\n\nIMPORTANT: Shut down your computer. Wait for 10 seconds and then turn power back ON. Login back into Windows before proceeding to the next step. \n\n Step-3: Run your VirtualBox installer and you should be good\n\nStep-4: Set yourself a reminder to turn ON the \"Memory Integrity\" setting back ON at a future date.\n\nhr\n\na href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vguhesan\" target=\"_blank\"img src=\"https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" style=\"height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;\" /a\n\n Today's Quote\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/logo/thiruvalluvar.png\" caption=\"\" width=\"100\" class=\"alignleft round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\nbr/\nThose who pretend to know what they don't, will be thought ignorant of even what they know.br/\n- a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvalluvar\" target=\"_blank\"Thiru Valluvar/a ( a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kural\" target=\"_blank\"His Work/a )\n\n&nbsp;",

        "content": "\n{{figure src=\"img/unsplash.jpg\" width=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\n\nWhat is this article about?\n\nWhen you move from a Mac OSX onto Windows, the file system will contain two files under every directory labeled \".DSStore\" and \"..DS_Store\". These files are not useful especially if you're trying to commit code under a Git source control. It can sometime get very annoying and to eliminate this \"noise\" from your day to day development, you may want to remove these artifacts from your Windows system. This article will walk you through the simple steps of removing those files.\n\n Performing the steps\n\nWindows \"find\" utility works differently than Linux \"find\". I highly recommend you use a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\"Cygwin/a (free). Cygwin provides you with Linux utilities under Windows. (Examples includes ls, rm, xargs, etc.) Once you have Cygwin, you can navigate to the base directory of you choice:\n\nExample: To navigate to the c:\\projects, you will run: \n\nprecode class=\"language-shell line-numbers\"cd /cygdrive/c/projects\n/code/pre\n\nOnce you're in the folder/directory of your choosing, you can then run the following two commands.\n\nprecode class=\"language-shell line-numbers\"# First let's find all occurrences of both \".DSStore\" and \"..DS_Store\" (recursive)     \nfind . -type f \\( -name \".DSStore\" -o -name \"..DS_Store\" \\) -print0\n    \nAfter we have ensured that the results are good then let's rerun and pipe it to the rm (remove) command via xargs\nfind . -type f \\( -name \".DSStore\" -o -name \"..DS_Store\" \\) -print0 | xargs -0 rm \n/code/pre\n\nThis should now remove all occurrences of those two files from a Windows directory (recursive)\n\nCheers\n\nhr\n\na href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vguhesan\" target=\"_blank\"img src=\"https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" style=\"height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;\" /a\n\n Today's Quote\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/logo/thiruvalluvar.png\" caption=\"\" width=\"100\" class=\"alignleft round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\nbr/\nThe roof of Peace rests upon the walls of understanding.br/\n- a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvalluvar\" target=\"_blank\"Thiru Valluvar/a ( a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kural\" target=\"_blank\"His Work/a )\n\n&nbsp;",

This article walks you though converting the JSON document to YAML using the \"jq\" tool.\n\na href=\"https://yaml.org/\" target=\"_blank\"Official YAML Spec/a\na href=\"https://www.json.org/json-en.html\" target=\"_blank\"Official JSON Spec/a\na href=\"https://stedolan.github.io/jq/\" taraget=\"_blank\"JQ Tool/a (jq is like 'sed' for JSON data)\n\n Why YAML (over JSON)?\n\nHere are a few reasons why developers prefer YAML over JSON:\n\nYAML is visually easier to look at. (Sometimes the {...} syntax with JSON can overwhelm your eyes with too much noise.)\nYAML has support for comments (JSON does not have a way to add comments.) YAML comments begin with the number sign (#)\nYAML has supports multiline strings using the \"block style indicator\" (|). It further enhances it with \"block chomping indicator\" with the use of (+), (-), default.\n  The block style indicates how newlines inside the block should behave.\n  The chomping indicator controls what should happen with newlines at the end of the string.\n  See a href=\"https://yaml-multiline.info/\" target=\"_blank\"YAML Multiline/a for a very good description on the usage.\n\nPrerequisite\n\nMake sure you have downloaded JQ and placed it in your PATH.\nEdit and place the following into ~/.jq\n\nprecode class=\"language-shell line-numbers\"def yamlify2:\n    (objects | to_entries | (map(.key | length) | max + 2) as $w |\n        .[] | (.value | type) as $type |\n        if $type == \"array\" then\n            \"\\(.key):\", (.value | yamlify2)\n        elif $type == \"object\" then\n            \"\\(.key):\", \"    \\(.value | yamlify2)\"\n        else\n            \"\\(.key):\\(\" \" * (.key | $w - length))\\(.value)\"\n        end\n    )\n    // (arrays | select(length  0)[] | [yamlify2] |\n        \"  - \\(.0])\", \"    \\(.[1:)\"\n    )\n    // .\n    ;\n/code/pre\n\nThe above code adds a new function \"yamlify2\" to your library of jq functions.\n\n JSON to YAML conversion using JQ\n\nNow we are ready to convert a JSON document to YAML.\n\nSyntax:\n\nprecode class=\"language-shell line-numbers\"jq -r yamlify2 input.json\n or\njq -r yamlify2 input.json  output.yaml\n/code/pre\n\nWorking Example:\n\nFilename: glossary.json\n\nprecode class=\"language-json line-numbers\"{\n    \"glossary\": {\n        \"title\": \"example glossary\",\n\t\t\"GlossDiv\": {\n            \"title\": \"S\",\n\t\t\t\"GlossList\": {\n                \"GlossEntry\": {\n                    \"ID\": \"SGML\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"SortAs\": \"SGML\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"GlossTerm\": \"Standard Generalized Markup Language\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Acronym\": \"SGML\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Abbrev\": \"ISO 8879:1986\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"GlossDef\": {\n                        \"para\": \"A meta-markup language, used to create markup languages such as DocBook.\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"GlossSeeAlso\": [\"GML\", \"XML\"]\n                    },\n\t\t\t\t\t\"GlossSee\": \"markup\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}/code/pre\n\nprecode class=\"language-shell line-numbers\"jq -r yamlify2 glossary.json\n or\njq -r yamlify2 glossary.json  glossary.yaml\n/code/pre\n\nResult (under glossary.yaml)\n\nprecode class=\"language-yaml line-numbers\"glossary:\n    title:     example glossary\n    GlossDiv:\n        title:      S\n        GlossList:\n            GlossEntry:\n                ID:         SGML\n                SortAs:     SGML\n                GlossTerm:  Standard Generalized Markup Language\n                Acronym:    SGML\n                Abbrev:     ISO 8879:1986\n                GlossDef:\n                    para:          A meta-markup language, used to create markup languages such as DocBook.\n                    GlossSeeAlso:\n                      GML\n                      XML\n                GlossSee:   markup\n/code/pre\n\nYou should have a YAML file ready to use in your project.\n\nCheers\n\nhr\n\na href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vguhesan\" target=\"_blank\"img src=\"https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" style=\"height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;\" /a\n\nToday's Quote\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/logo/thiruvalluvar.png\" caption=\"\" width=\"100\" class=\"alignleft round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\nbr/\nAll the wealth acquired with perseverance (hard-work) by the worthy is for the exercise of benevolence (kindness).br/\n\nKural 212\n  - a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvalluvar\" target=\"_blank\"Thiru Valluvar/a ( a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kural\" target=\"_blank\"His Work/a )\n\n&nbsp;\n",

        "content": "\n{{figure src=\"img/unsplash.png\" width=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\n\nWhat is this article about?\n\nArticle shows you how to change your humidifier canister for Honeywell HM750A1000 Advanced Electrode Steam Humidifier.\n\n Why?\n\nBefore you turn on the heat this fall, they recommend that you change the canister each year. According to the manual, and I quote:\n\"Cylinder light [o] : This yellow LED will illuminate when the humidifier has determined that the cylinder is nearing the end of its life, due to scale accumulation on the electrodes. The LED will flash on and off, during which time the humidifier will continue to operate as normal. After 7 days of flashing, the LED will remain on solid, and the humidifier will not generate steam. The cylinder must be replaced. See \"Cylinder Replacement KIT\" on page 19. of the manual.\"\n\nProbably best to replace it before you turn ON the heat. Otherwise, you need to drain first to release the steam to avoid burns.\n\nThe cylinder kit: Honeywell HM750ACYL\n\nAvailable at Amazon a href=\"https://a.co/d/b7YnmKi\" target=\"blank\"here/a (I am _not an affiliate of this vendor or site)\n\na href=\"https://www.manualslib.com/products/Honeywell-Hm750a1000-8855966.html\" target=\"_blank\"Honeywell HM750A1000 Manual/a\n\n DISCLAIMER: It is always important to follow all safety standards and procedures as outlined in the product manual. My steps below are only supplimental to the manual.\n\n TIP: You need to shut off the drain valve before you remove the canister. Trace the copper tube going out of the unit to the inlet going to your hot water heater. You will find the shut-off valve.\n\nAlso, don't forget to... Disconnect main power source before accessing internal compartments.\n\nI have created a one-page illustration to help guide the process.\n\n{{figure src=\"img/How-To-Change-Humidifier-Canister-Honeywell-HM750A1000.png\" width=\"100%\" class=\"aligncenter round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\na href=\"img/How-To-Change-Humidifier-Canister-Honeywell-HM750A1000.png\" target=\"_blank\"Open image in full-screen/a\n\nStep-By-Step instructions\n\nTurn OFF your Nest HVAC.\nPower OFF the unit. Will take upto ten minutes to drain and shutoff.\nTurn OFF the incoming water valve.\nTurn OFF at the circuit breaker for humidifier.\nWait for 10-20 mins (in case there is any steam build up).\nRemove the three electrical plugs.\nRelease the two clamps and rubber should come off with some force.\nTwist and lift the canister. Keep a paper towel handy at the bottom to catch any run off water.\nClean the drain valve (bottom) of any debris.\n10. Drop in the new canister and reverse the process above.\n\nCheers\n\nhr\n\nIf you would like to show your support then consider subscribing below and/or buy me a cup of joe:\n\na href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vguhesan\" target=\"_blank\"img src=\"https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" style=\"height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;\" /a\n\n Today's Quote\n\n{{figure src=\"/img/logo/thiruvalluvar.png\" caption=\"\" width=\"100\" class=\"alignleft round-img-border imgframe-left-pad\" }}\nbr/\nAll the wealth acquired with perseverance (hard-work) by the worthy is for the exercise of benevolence (kindness).br/\n\nKural 212\n  - a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvalluvar\" target=\"_blank\"Thiru Valluvar/a ( a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kural\" target=\"_blank\"His Work/a )\n\n&nbsp;\n",

        "title": "Angular - Components within Components",
        "content": " It's good to be back blogging after a long hiatus. :-)\n\nWith the earlier versions of Angular creating nested components was not possible but with Angular6+ you can create nested components within components. Here's how you can create them using the angular-cli. You can also perform the steps manually by creating the needed files one by one under a hierarchical structure as shown below.\n\nLet's take a look at an example of what we are trying to create.\n\nWhy nest Angular Components?\n\nLet's say we have a \"Shopping\" feature (as shown in this example below) and we want to have sub-components such as \"Shopping-List\", \"Shopping-List-Edit\" option and so on. Traditionally, you would have created that as a flat list of components all organized under the /app directory. But as the project grows or as you have more team-members added to your project, you project gets more complex and you end up with too many files under /app directory making it difficult to manage and support. So having a hierarchical structure for your components makes sense. This also creates a mental visual as to how each of the components are related.\n\nHere is how you will create the nested components under Angular (using the Angular-cli)\n\nprecode class=\"language-javascript line-numbers\"\n// long-form, generates shopping component artifacts\nng generate component shopping\n// short-form\nng g c shopping\n// Create shopping-list below shopping\n// Generates shopping-list artifacts under shopping component\nng g c shopping/shopping-list\n\n// * Complex Use-Case - Adding Components Into A Different Module *\n\n// Using components with same name (not recommended)\n// Let's say you had multiple modules,\n// where you may have app.module.ts and leftnav.module.ts\n// and you wanted to create this about-us under each module but\n// use the same name then you can do the following\nng g c shopping/about-us --module=app.module\nng g c left-nav/about-us --module=leftnav.module\n// This will add the newly created components as a member of that particular module.\n/code/pre\n    \n    \n    \n\nIt's that simple.\n\nIf you find this article useful, consider bookmarking, subscribing and/or sharing it on your favorite social channels so that others can also find and read these articles. I do this out of love and passion to share my ideas, thoughts, findings and knowledge with others. So the more you help me share the more my content can reach others. Thank you for helping spread the word!\n\nNow for Today's Inspiration:\n\n Three Steps In Cultivating Willpower:\n\n 1. Finish what you begin.\n 2. Do a little bit more than you think you can.\n 3. Do a little bit better than you think you can.\n\nCheers!",

        "content": "I had a requirement where I had WiFi signal across a large farm/garden and I needed to place the Blink camera in various locations. And since the schedule is controlled by the Blink Sync Module, I had to create multiple zones each with it's own Blink Sync module to define an independent schedule for a set of cameras for that zone. This meant that each of my Blink Sync modules needed to be accessible in those zones across the farm.\n\nRequirement:  \nWater-Proof the Blink Sync module such that it can be powered at each location locally.\n\nI searched (on Amazon and in other places) for a mount that is water-tight such as the Blink Camera's but I was running out of options. And so I decided to retrofit my own design. And here it is:\n\nParts:\n\nPolycase (SL-64FMBT) ...... x 1\nVelcro... to suit your needs\n3/8 inch metallic push in connector ........  x 1 (optional)\nSilicone Sealant Tube .............................. x 1\n\nInstructions:\n\nYou can secure the Blink Sync module inside the Polycase using the velcro.\nDrill a hole to run the USB wire through the 3/8 inch metallic push in connector.\nSeal the usb cable and push in connector using the silicone sealant. Recommend that you poke the hole at the bottom so the water collected (via moisture) has a way to drain.\nPlug your other end of the USB cable into a water proof enclosure for power.\nDrill two holes to mount the Polycase enclosure in a suitable area.\n\nMore finished pictures coming up soon.\n\nIf you have your own versions on how you have water-proofed your Blink Sync module, share them here on this wiki.\n\nCheers.\n\n\\--",
