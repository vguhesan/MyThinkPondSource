      <description>One of the first things I found as I was getting familiar with Wicket is how do you point to resources that are part of a page. Well I did some digging around to find out so I&amp;rsquo;m documenting it here for others who might be facing the same challenges as they discover Apache Wicket.&#xA;Problem: You have pages in Wicket that are HTML with &amp;ldquo;Wicket&amp;rdquo; tags. But then you might want to point to resources such as CSS style sheets or JavaScript that&amp;rsquo;s part of a page.</description>
