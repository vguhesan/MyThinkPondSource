It can capture all of the the environmental data needed to transform a wide variety of ordinary household objects into smart devices. Plug the module into an electrical outlet and it becomes the eyes and ears of the room, its 10 embedded sensors logging information like sound, humidity, electromagnetic noise, motion, and light (the researchers excluded a camera for privacy reasons).</description>
