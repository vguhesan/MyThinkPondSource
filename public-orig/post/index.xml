      <description>How to copy a file in small portions into a target file? Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the why?&#xA;When you copy large files, you want to ensure that you are copying it piece by piece to avoid out-of-memory errors. As a good practice, it&amp;rsquo;s best to consider optimizations during development to avoid edge cases that might creep up in production.&#xA;Imagine a scenario where your copy file has been working flawlessly until one fine day when a 5GB file is thrown at it to be copied from one location to another.</description>

      <guid>http://MyThinkPond.com/post/waterproofing-blink-camera-sync-module-for-outdoors/</guid>
      <description>I had a requirement where I had WiFi signal across a large farm/garden and I needed to place the Blink camera in various locations. And since the schedule is controlled by the Blink Sync Module, I had to create multiple zones each with it&amp;rsquo;s own Blink Sync module to define an independent schedule for a set of cameras for that zone. This meant that each of my Blink Sync modules needed to be accessible in those zones across the farm.</description>

      <description>When creating an uber-jar with all dependencies in one single-jar file, each of the spring dependency jar may contain schema and handlers that have the same name but different content. When you combine them into creating a single uber-jar, the uber-library will perform an overwrite since each of the Spring files for schema and handlers are the exact filename. So you end up overwriting the file where the last ubered file will remain.</description>

The objective of this blog article is to describe his achievement and to provide a scientific detail around his invention (which I found lacking in other articles on-line). I felt that by providing the foundation and a road-map on how he devised the solution will encourage others to follow their inner creativity and dreams to achieve their desires and goals.</description>

With a little bit of Encouragement and with Desire, Stength and Determination - all things are possible!</description>

So to help clarify, I&amp;rsquo;m blogging a few notes in hope that it helps clarify how the context works.</description>

      <description>We now exist an interesting interstitial moment, one defined by big corporations producing much of the innovation and some of the world’s richest companies – Apple, Amazon, Uber, Facebook – trying to solve big hairy problems. These are the problems that startups would have once solved but because they are so expensive – I’m talking about commercial VR, self-driving trucks, gene editing, and the like – there are no startups capitalized to tackle them.</description>

      <description>Life on Earth goes back at least two billion years, but it was only in the last half-billion that it would have been visible to the naked eye. One of the enduring questions among biologists is how life made the jump from microbes to the multicellular plants and animals who rule the planet today. Now, scientists have analyzed chemical traces of life in rocks that are up to a billion years old, and they discovered how a dramatic ice age may have led to the multicellular tipping point.</description>

      <description>**Synthetic Sensors** : a simple device that plugs into an electrical outlet and connects everything in the room. It can capture all of the the environmental data needed to transform a wide variety of ordinary household objects into smart devices. Plug the module into an electrical outlet and it becomes the eyes and ears of the room, its 10 embedded sensors logging information like sound, humidity, electromagnetic noise, motion, and light (the researchers excluded a camera for privacy reasons).</description>

      <description>Scientists working in the Arctic circle over the past few decades have unearthed several massive viruses that some say could be re-awakened if the permafrost that imprisons them dissolves. Recently, some researchers have suggested that these enormous viruses could thaw out, escape, and make lots of people sick. It sounds like something out of a 1990s horror film. But you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t get too concerned — at least not yet.</description>

      <description>[![](/img/2017/05/quantum-computing-whole-new-kind-of-programmer-1-1068x601.jpg)](https://singularityhub.com/2017/05/09/quantum-computing-demands-a-whole-new-kind-of-programmer/)Quantum computers finally seem to be coming of age with promises of “quantum supremacy” by the end of the year. But there’s a problem—very few people know how to work them. The bold claim of achieving &#34;quantum supremacy&#34; came on the back of Google unveiling a new quantum chip design. The hyperbolic phrase essentially means building a quantum device that can perform a calculation impossible for any conventional computer. The technology has a major challenge to overcome.</description>

      <guid>http://MyThinkPond.com/2017/05/11/nanofridge-could-keep-quantum-computers-cool-enough-to-calculate/</guid>
      <description>Quantum computers need to be kept cool, just like regular computers, but an ordinary fan won’t cut it. A nanofridge that sorts electrons by temperature just might keep it cool enough to allow quantum compute.&#xA;Classical computers require built-in fans and other ways to dissipate heat, and quantum computers are no different. Instead of working with bits of information that can be either 0 or 1, as in a classical machine, a quantum computer relies on “qubits”, which can be in both states simultaneously – called a superposition – thanks to the quirks of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>Physicists have found a new way to turn &#39;wonder material&#39; graphene into a ridiculously powerful superconductor, capable of shuttling electricity with zero resistance. That&amp;rsquo;s important, because if we could find a way to achieve superconductivity at room temperature, it would lead to vastly more efficient electronic devices, not to mention power lines. Right now, energy companies are losing about 7 percent of their energy as heat as a result of resistance in the grid.</description>

      <description>A new kind of AI algorithm—designed to work with a small amount of data—may be able to assist in the early stages of drug development. Artificial intelligence doesn’t work all that well in situations where there is very little data, such as drug development. A new technique called one-shot learning, that requires only a small number of data points might be a solution to that low-data problem.&#xA;To make molecular information more digestible, the researchers first represented each molecule in terms of the connections between atoms (what a mathematician would call a graph).</description>

      <description>uvloop is a fast, drop-in replacement of the built-in asyncio event loop. uvloop is implemented in Cython and uses libuv under the hood.&#xA;Benefits: uvloop makes asyncio 2-4x faster.&#xA;Cons: uvloop is available from PyPI but it requires Python 3.5. (The reason for this is asyncio was introduced in Python 3.4 and above.) Unless your project is based on Python 3.4+ - you may not be able to leverage this library.</description>

      <description>Researchers say tens of thousands of sites are using JavaScript libraries that are years old and contain publicly known vulnerabilities.&#xA;An analysis of over 133,000 websites has found that 37 percent of them have at least one JavaScript library with a known vulnerability. There are no reliable vulnerability databases, no security mailing lists maintained by library vendors, few or no details on security issues in release notes, and often, it is difficult to determine which versions of a library are affected by a specific reported vulnerability.</description>

      <description>The new film works by a process called radiative cooling. This takes advantage of that fact that Earth’s atmosphere allows certain wavelengths of heat-carrying infrared radiation to escape into space unimpeded. Convert unwanted heat into infrared of the correct wavelength, then, and you can dump it into the cosmos with no come back. &amp;hellip;their film, placed atop an average American house, would be enough to keep the internal temperature at 20°C on a day when it was 37°C outside.</description>

      <description>Blockchain technology is not a technology solely for Bitcoin but rather a creative way to keep a digital ledger of economic transactions. This technology can be applied in a variety of fields such that the chain cannot be owned by a single entity and has no single point of failure. It provides a backbone with transparency and incorruptibility. Imagine a world where every transaction, whether it is a real-estate property transaction or a work-contract or an acknowledgement receipt of a email or an acceptance of work or payment or a medication delivery system releasing a medication into a patients blood-stream can be recorded such that it is indisputable and irrevocable.</description>

      <description>In CentOS 7, a lot of the command-line utilities for configuring and troubleshooting network properties like arp, ifconfig, iptunnel, iwconfig, nameif, netstat, route - are no longer there in the new CentOS 7 version. While still included in many Linux Distributions, (and you may be tempted to run - &amp;lsquo;yum install net-tools&amp;rsquo; - to get them back into your Linux footprint). But they are considered deprecated and therefore should be phased out in favor of more modern replacements.</description>

      <description>This article focuses on synchronizing/updating the clock in your guest linux VM after you restore a VirtualBox snapshot.&#xA;When you create a VirtualBox snapshot, it&amp;rsquo;s essentially a photo taken and frozen in time. All bits including the date and time are frozen to that instant. When you restore a snapshot, the Linux guest VM system is restored back to that snapshot including the date and time. This may not be desired all the time especially if the purpose is to restore the configuration and settings to an earlier time but your want to roll forward the clock on the VM to the present instance.</description>

      <description>Recently visited the Basilica of the National Shrine and each time I visit this beautiful place I&amp;rsquo;m spellbound. It is one of the hidden gems to visit when you are visiting the capital. Here are some pictures from my recent visit.&#xA;Click here for the photos from the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Michigan Avenue, Washington, DC. The beautiful murals are a work of art!</description>

      <title>How to package your node.js application for deploying it in an offline environment?</title>

      <description>Personally speaking, I prefer to have a self-contained bundle with all the artifacts and modules that might be required to deploy an application (not just Node.js application) in Production. In that way, I know exactly the bits that were installed and nothing more and nothing less. It also eliminates the availability of the NPM modules and network connectivity issues, etc. The following procedure shows you how to create a simple &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; Node.</description>

      <description>Came across this tiny IoT embedded micro-controller/computer that runs BusyBox or FreeBSD Linux and can run code written in Node.js, Python, C/C++, Ruby and PHP all at a cost of $5 to $10 with WiFi, 2G/3G, Bluetooth, GPS add-ons for your cloud services. It also has enough GPIO pins to interface with external world and not to mention the I2C and I2S interfaces for talking to other devices and peripherals as well as interfacing for sounds (I2S).</description>

      <description>In Python, most libraries are available using the pip install process. But for cases, where you are distributing code to be installed in customer sites where you may or may not have a internet connection to the pip libraries, you resort to the legacy setup.py process.&#xA;When you install using the setup.py process, the setup.py copies it&amp;rsquo;s collection of python files to the site-packages folder for your python virtual-environment. On a CentOS, this might be a location under (/usr/lib/python2.</description>

      <description>This past weekend when Ellicott City was hit with the worst storm in over hundred years, we ended up camping out in Rocky Gap State Park. Last year when we were out camping it rained a little and I had no tarp below my tent. So as soon as I got home last season, I ordered a tarp and had it ready this time. But some lessons are learned the hard way.</description>

      <description>This past week, Ellicott City, Maryland had one of the worst floods in a long time. You can see some of the devastation that it has caused in this link. Fortunately, only my basement had a little bit of flooding. But interestingly, this has been the second flooding in over a month. This made me question the drain at the bottom of the walk-down/walk-up basement.&#xA;Here is a picture of the drain at the bottom of the stairwell.</description>

      <description>In CentOS 6.8, the init system that brings up all the services (link autoexec files in Windows) was called SysV- Init. This has been the foundation for ages as long I&amp;rsquo;ve been using CentOS. But in the latest release of CentOS (CentOS 7+) the init engine has been moved to a more favorable engine labeled SystemD. SystemD is the init engine behind Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat and CentOS. So the standardization is good for the Linux community but moving from CentOS 6.</description>

      <title>WaitUntilPortOpens() - How to wait until process A runs and binds to a port before spawning process B?</title>

      <description>Sometimes we have situations where you need to wait until one application is loaded that may bind to a certain port before kicking off a second application that may depend on that port. This process is typically described as &amp;ldquo;Wait-Until-Port-Opens&amp;rdquo; (or it could be the reverse - where you want to wait until a port closes).&#xA;Here are some use-cases for this method or script:&#xA;You have a Java web application (Jetty, Tomcat, WildFly, etc) that listens on port 8080 and you want your Nginx or Apache HTTPd server to start as a proxy-server once that back-end web server is bound to port 8080.</description>

      <description>Bizarre fourth state of water discovered Scientists at the Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) have discovered that when (water) put under extreme pressure in small spaces, the life-giving liquid can exhibit a strange fourth state known as &#34;tunneling&#34;. Quantum tunneling means that a particle, or in this case a molecule, can overcome a barrier and be on both sides of it at once – or anywhere in between. Think of rolling a ball down one side of a hill and up another.</description>

      <description>The spherical genius of the Hüttlin Kugelmotor Electrical motors are an energy-efficient method for driving vehicles but battery technology is simply not going to advance quickly enough for all-electric vehicles to be a practical reality for most uses anytime soon. The near and mid-term future is undoubtedly a combination of compact combustion engine generators charging dense battery packs that drive electric motors - the &#34;range extender&#34; option. After nearly twenty years of development another &amp;ldquo;range extender&amp;rdquo; candidate is going through final testing and it is a work of elegant genius - Dr.</description>

Today’s ruling is a victory for consumers and innovators who deserve unfettered access to the entire web, and it ensures the internet remains a platform for unparalleled innovation, free expression and economic growth</description>

Then I thought of all the complexities of setting up a MySQL database, creating and registering the site with WP Jetpack, etc. I wanted something quick, easy to maintain and something that I can hand over to someone else for maintaining.</description>

      <description>Much of the Egyptian/Nubian history and culture we know today was a result of colonization by the European empires. In their thirst for expansion, they colonized much of the known world.&#xA;In India, the Dutch, the Portuguese then the British all came under the name of colonization and expansion. They came in search of new trade-routes to the orient and as history has it, the interests of trade slowly turned into colonization and expansion of the empire.</description>

      <description>You may have observed once in a while that when you SSH onto a server and you try to look up a command you ran earlier (maybe the previous day) in the &amp;ldquo;history&amp;rdquo; output but you do not see it. This is because of how a SSH session works! Each time you ssh into a server, it leverages a set of TTY screens to maintain an individual history for that session.</description>

      <description>Prior to CentOS 7, &amp;ldquo;iptables&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;shorewall&amp;rdquo; were the two options avaiable. Since CentOS-7, the default firewall tool is &amp;ldquo;firewalld&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Here is a short-guide on how to open two ports in the firewalld application:&#xA;firewall-cmd --get-active-zones # Lets open Jetty Web Server port firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent # Lets open some other port 4242 for TCP firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=4242/tcp --permanent # Commit changes firewall-cmd --reload firewall-cmd --list-all Cheers.</description>

      <description>CentOS 7 uses Systemd for managing services (prior to CentOS 7 it was using upstart-init.d to manage the services).&#xA;Step-1: Create CentOS 7 Service file: vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/opentsdb.service&#xA;[Unit] Description=OpenTSDB Service After=network.target hbase.service [Service] Type=forking PrivateTmp=yes ExecStart=/usr/share/opentsdb/etc/init.d/opentsdb start ExecStop=/usr/share/opentsdb/etc/init.d/opentsdb stop Restart=on-abort [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Step-2: Let&amp;rsquo;s test the start and stop of this new OpenTSDB service&#xA;$ sudo systemctl start opentsdb # If it starts up good, you should see the website when you goto http://&amp;amp;amp;lt;servername&amp;amp;amp;gt;:4242/ ps -leaf | grep &amp;amp;amp;quot;tsdb&amp;amp;amp;quot; # shows you something similar then you can add it as a service to auto-start sudo systemctl enable opentsdb Step-3: (optional) Reboot node and make sure that the service starts up accordingly after a reboot.</description>

      <description>Hello All:&#xA;I am writing today&amp;rsquo;s blog filled with tears and a sad heart to let the readers know that there are about 2 million people that are displaced in the city of Chennai, India today due to the recent massive floods. This flood is the worst seen in over 100 years in Chennai&amp;rsquo;s history. The last time this happened, Chennai (ancient city called Madrasapatinam) was not as densely populated as today (although we do not have actual numbers because census data is not available from 100 years ago).</description>

      <description>When getting started on ZeroMQ (version 4.2.0 or above) can be quite challenging especially with all the prerequisites. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a good two days to get the process ironed out. So I&amp;rsquo;m sharing this so that others can avoid the same pitfalls and can have a good head-start with setting up their environment.&#xA;Pitfall #1: Develop for your platform. I&amp;rsquo;m accustomed to developing in Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTE but in this case my deployment environment happens to be CentOS 6.</description>

      <description>While I was visiting Home Depot, I saw a Philips SlimStyle 60W LED bulb on clearance for two-dollars. I could not resist buying it for a tear-down to see how it&amp;rsquo;s built. I always wondered how they convert the 120VAC to a regulated DC voltage with high-current feed for lighting up those LED&amp;rsquo;s. So here is the first version of the tear-down showing you what&amp;rsquo;s inside the bulb. I will blog more about the current and voltage at the LED junction on a subsequent blog.</description>

      <description>In Grails using the templating (Sitemesh) if you were to include per-page JavaScript resources then it shows up much earlier in the layout content as part of the &amp;lt;g:layoutBody&amp;gt;&#xA;Here is an example illustrating the problem:&#xA;SamplePage.gsp [sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;html&amp;rdquo;]&#xA;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; MyThinkPond.com Custom Page ... Some this page content [/sourcecode]&#xA;and the layout page (layoutPage.gsp) [sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;html&amp;rdquo;]&#xA;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; ... Some template (header) content [/sourcecode]&#xA;results in the following page in browser [sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;html&amp;rdquo;]</description>

      <description>With a new Grails 2.X project you run into challenges on which folders to check-in into a GIT repository. You want to remove any non-essential files that Grails can rebuild at run-time. And if you are using either GITHub or BitBucket for your GIT repo&amp;rsquo;s the default .gitignore file created or provided by GITHub is setup for configured for a Grails 1.X project and not a Grails 2.X project.</description>

      <description>Recently I decided to port some of my development using ZeroMQ onto my CentOS development machine and I ran into some challenges. I&amp;rsquo;m documenting those challenges so that if someone else runs into the same pitfalls I did, they can avoid it.&#xA;In this example today, we will work with the first &amp;ldquo;HelloWorld&amp;rdquo; examples in the ZeroMQ guide found here. I added a few modifications to the sample such as a package name and a try-catch around the Thread and an exception.</description>

      <description>Lately there has been a lot of synergy and publicity around node.js (especially if you want to utilize the robust features of a JavaScript language on the server-side). If you are not familiar with this, I would suggest you look at the following link:&#xA;Node.js - Event-driven I/O server-side JavaScript environment based on V8.&#xA;If you are a Java developer and as you try out the examples, you will notice how this will be a great addition into your infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you want an easy way to simulate load on a file-system that you are trying to test. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick and easy way.&#xA;Suppose your mount point you want to perform this IO is &amp;ldquo;/myspecialmount&amp;rdquo;. (Assuming you have plenty of space to test)&#xA;Then the easiest way to load some IO is through the following bash-script:&#xA;[sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo;] #!/bin/bash&#xA;while true do echo &amp;ldquo;=== Starting clean-up ====&amp;rdquo; rm -fr /myspecialmount/usr echo &amp;ldquo;=== Starting load ====&amp;rdquo; rsync -avp /usr /myspecialmount done [/sourcecode]</description>

      <description>The traditional way to test for websockets is this:&#xA;[sourcecode] function WebSocketTest() { if (&amp;ldquo;WebSocket&amp;rdquo; in window) { alert(&amp;ldquo;Browser supports websocket&amp;rdquo;); } else { alert(&amp;ldquo;Browser does not support websocket&amp;rdquo;); } } &amp;hellip; Run WebSocket test [/sourcecode]&#xA;Although the above example will be technically correct for modern browsers it is important to consider some of the &amp;ldquo;experimental&amp;rdquo; implementation of this feature in earlier FireFox (Mozilla) browsers.&#xA;In FireFox (Mozilla), experimental features (until they graduate) gets added with a prefix of &amp;ldquo;Moz&amp;rdquo;.</description>

The possibilities are endless.&#xA;Here how the process works:</description>

      <title>Configure static resources in Django - Python</title>

      <description>Working on a Django project, one of the first things that one would encounter is configuring Django for static resources such as &amp;ldquo;css&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;images&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;jpeg&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;js&amp;rdquo;. In looking at the &amp;ldquo;StaticResources&amp;rdquo; link that&amp;rsquo;s part of the Django documentation, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit cryptic for someone who&amp;rsquo;s starting out in Django and Python. So here&amp;rsquo;s a step-by-step on two ways to configure your static-resources in a Django project.&#xA;This method is described in the Django documentation and is probably the preferred approach.</description>

      <description>If you tried upgrading to Python 2.7 on CentOS, you will quickly find out that the RPM&amp;rsquo;s don&amp;rsquo;t exist for this in the repos. So here&amp;rsquo;s a short summary of what I did to upgrade my Python to 2.7 on CentOS.&#xA;Based on a few Google searches&amp;hellip; I discovered that a few dependent packages are required before you try upgrading to Python 2.7.&#xA;[sourcecode]&#xA;yum -y groupinstall &amp;lsquo;Development Tools&amp;rsquo; yum -y install openssl-devel* ncurses-devel* zlib*.</description>

      <description>Developing with Grails and Groovy can be a blessing and and pain all at the same time. The development moves at a rapid rate but when you decide to include libraries that depend on other libraries, your pain starts to build up. For example, when you include the module &amp;ldquo;HttpBuilder&amp;quot;in your project you may run into issues with Xerces and xml-apis, especially when you attempt to deploy the WAR file under Tomcat.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure if you have been developing with Java and Tomcat for sometime, you are likely to run into the infamous debug error.&#xA;SEVERE: Error listenerStart&#xA;You will most likely start Googling it trying to find out what the heck is going on. And in trying to see the extended logging on what that &amp;ldquo;listenerStart&amp;rdquo; error means. After some lucky searches, you will see links asking you to drop a &amp;ldquo;log4j.</description>

      <description>When you invoke a batch file or most applications in a command-prompt and when you wish to close the application by doing a CTRL+C, you get the annoying &amp;ldquo;Terminate batch job (Y/N)?&amp;rdquo; prompt. And in most cases, even if you type a &amp;ldquo;n&amp;rdquo;, it still kills the application. Example is the Tomcat startup. To avoid this, try this:&#xA;[sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;jscript&amp;rdquo;]&#xA;YourScript.cmd &amp;lt; Nul&#xA;[/sourcecode]&#xA;This should no longer ask you with the annoying prompt &amp;ldquo;Terminate batch job (Y/N)?</description>

      <description>One of the questions posed by a friend of mine is this.&#xA;In a typical website-application, you spawn a few child windows here and there and because of the nature of the application, you do not have a handle to all the child windows you spawn open... Then how do you close all the child windows that belong to your application when the user logs out of your application or closes the main window with the intent that he/she wants to log out?</description>

      <description>The answer is a lot simpler than you think. But before we explore the answer, I should warn you that this approach is not what is recommended by Maven. Maven builds upon consistency and structure and this process goes away from that methodology. In Maven, you can take each of your jars\libraries and add them to your local repository and then include them as needed in your projects. If you want to go the proper route here’s how you do it.</description>

      <description>When trying to integrate both Spring and GWT, one might encounter the following error in the Spring Eclipse IDE:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;java.net.InetAddress is a restricted class&amp;rdquo;. The problem happens when you try to use Spring configuration for your database. In my case, I was using Spring to update data back to a H2 database.&#xA;Well, here&amp;rsquo;s one way to deal with this issue. Disable the &amp;ldquo;Google App Engine&amp;rdquo;. Yes, based on my research, if you&amp;rsquo;re using GWT, you can disable Google App Engine and still continue your development with GWT.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Twitter for sometime now. And I&amp;rsquo;ve always wondered about the settings in Twitter, especially one particular setting - &amp;ldquo;public vs private&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Let me first review the setting. If you set your privacy settings to &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo;, then all posts after that time-line will only be available to the followers that you have allowed. And if at some point of time, you decide to toggle it to &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo;, then all posts (even the ones you sent in the past - as private) becomes open to the public.</description>

Before you do this, make sure you are NOT doing this in a production environment. By doing this in a real-production environment, you may be compromising the security of your production infrastructure.</description>

Whereas with 1.8.1, you will need to move those &amp;ldquo;Init&amp;rdquo; properties to the main level so that they will be properly found and used.</description>

We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.&#xA;We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m blogging it in hopes that if others are looking for it, this entry would help them.&#xA;You can find javax.servlet and other jars under &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;BEA_HOME&amp;gt;\modules&amp;quot; folder. In my specific build, I have the servlet jar file as &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;BEA_HOME&amp;gt;\modules\javax.servlet_1.0.0.0_2-5.jar&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;So if you are looking for it that&amp;rsquo;s where it is and no need to go and download the servlet.</description>

Namely, the splash screen.&#xA;When you load up a native application, it&amp;rsquo;s very traditional to display a &amp;ldquo;splash screen&amp;rdquo; with the company logo and branding of the particular product.</description>

      <description>I have been a strong supporter of Open Source technologies including Java, Python, Scala, Ruby and Perl for many, many years. But in order to be a strong Enterprise Architect, it&amp;rsquo;s best to also understand the various other technologies (some proprietary) to gain a broader-balanced view of technology and whats out there. And in this ever changing world of technology - knowing the various options you have can make the difference between being nimble and creative to an implementation that bites the dust.</description>

      <title>Java 6 Gems: Scripting Framework to support Rhino Javascript and Groovy (natively)</title>

      <description>What is it? With Java 6 there is a new addition (package: javax.script) that allows you to work with scripting languages like Javascript (using Rhino) and Groovy. Although there is built in support for adding scripting engines like Groovy, PHP, Perl, etc - what&amp;rsquo;s bundled in this release is Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Rhino Javascript Engine.&#xA;Why embed a scripting language? Most scripting languages out there are dynamically typed. Meaning, your code does not need to know what type of value you will be storing in a particular field at compile time.</description>

      <description>Today we are going to look at a new feature available in Java 5 and above that can speed up your load time of your jar&amp;rsquo;s within your applets and web start (provided you have a web server that&amp;rsquo;s hosting the jar that&amp;rsquo;s HTTP/1.1 compatible server).&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s first take a look at what happens on the back-end:&#xA;In a typical applet (same applies to a web-start application), you have a src/source tag that points to a JAR file like this:</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;ll comment on a commonly overlooked feature now available in Java (since Java 5.0) called &amp;ldquo;varargs&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;How many times have you done this?&#xA;[sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;jscript&amp;rdquo;]&#xA;public ConstructorOne(String personFullName){ // Does something }&#xA;//and later on added another constructor that took another parameter&#xA;public ConstructorOne(String personFirstName, String personLastName){ // Now breaks down the name to pass along two strings instead of one. }&#xA;// and so on&amp;hellip;&#xA;[/sourcecode]&#xA;Well, not anymore.</description>

      <title>jQuery Accordian Internet Explorer 6 Issue</title>

      <description>If you are using the Accordian UI from jQuery and your accordion body (the content in div.ui-accordion-content tag) contains anchor tags then you might experience a few glitches in IE6 where the display might not render properly when selected.&#xA;One way to address this issue is the following: Add this to the header&amp;hellip;&#xA;[sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;jscript&amp;rdquo;]&#xA;[/sourcecode]&#xA;This will force a refresh of the content when expanded.&#xA;The other thing that you may not have is a doctype defined in the header.</description>

      <description>Found a neat little browser download helper tool. It&amp;rsquo;s one that I&amp;rsquo;ll be using and it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a tool to add to your browser toolkit bookmarks.&#xA;Ever been in a situation where you wanted to download a file at the office but the particular extension is not allowed at the company. Well, this tool might help you in those situations. It&amp;rsquo;s called Grab-N-Zip (http://www.GrabNZip.com)&#xA;You enter your URL to the file that you are trying to &amp;ldquo;grab&amp;rdquo; from the internet.</description>

      <title>Scala compile message - Class file or Jar is broken</title>

      <description>Sometimes when compiling my Scala code, the compiler output may need a little bit of help in sorting out what&amp;rsquo;s the real issue.&#xA;For example, when I compiled today I received the following error:&#xA;[sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;jscript&amp;rdquo;]&#xA;[scalac] error: error while loading DefaultHttpClient, class file &amp;lsquo;C:\A_OpenSource\WicketNotesApp\lib\httpclient-4.0.jar(org/apache/http/impl/client/DefaultHttpClient.class)&amp;rsquo; is broken [scalac] (class net.jcip.annotations.ThreadSafe not found.)&#xA;[scalac] error: error while loading AbstractHttpClient, class file &amp;lsquo;C:\A_OpenSource\WicketNotesApp\lib\httpclient-4.0.jar(org/apache/http/impl/client/AbstractHttpClient.class)&amp;rsquo; is broken [scalac] (class net.jcip.annotations.ThreadSafe not found.)&#xA;[/sourcecode]&#xA;And my instinct tells me to focus on the jar file or the class file and in this case, &amp;ldquo;DefaultHttpClient.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we need to forward to a servlet or resource that&amp;rsquo;s outside of Wicket such as a servlet. Here&amp;rsquo;s how:&#xA;Modify your web.xml to define your servlet as well as your Wicket application &amp;ldquo;ignorePaths&amp;rdquo; init-param: [sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;xml&amp;rdquo;]&#xA;&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;UTF-8&#34;?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC &#34;-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN&#34; &#34;http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd&#34;&gt; Wicket Example MyApplication org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WicketFilter applicationClassName com.gu.MyApplication wicket.configuration deployment ignorePaths images/,s/ MyApplication /* SomeServlet com.gu.SomeServlet SomeServlet /s/koolkat.do [/sourcecode] The first observation is that Wicket is running as a Filter and not a Servlet.</description>

      <title>ContextPath in Apache Wicket</title>

      <description>One of the first things I found as I was getting familiar with Wicket is how do you point to resources that are part of a page. Well I did some digging around to find out so I&amp;rsquo;m documenting it here for others who might be facing the same challenges as they discover Apache Wicket.&#xA;Problem: You have pages in Wicket that are HTML with &amp;ldquo;Wicket&amp;rdquo; tags. But then you might want to point to resources such as CSS style sheets or JavaScript that&amp;rsquo;s part of a page.</description>

      <description>Downloaded the Community Edition of IntelliJ a few days ago. Although most J2EE features are not available in the community edition, one of the features that did like was the Scala Plugin.&#xA;After I downloaded it and added the scala plug-in, I was very impressed with the tool. I have been using Eclipse (a little Netbeans) for most of my Java development and although I have tried the scala plugin that&amp;rsquo;s available for Eclipse, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t all that impressed.</description>

      <description>Open Link In PDF In New Window&#xA;Sometimes you like to link out to other URL&amp;rsquo;s or other PDF&amp;rsquo;s from within a PDF document. And you will notice that this replaces the existing HTML frame (if you had served the original PDF from a website) or window with the new document making it hard to navigate. In these cases, you would prefer to open the link in the PDF onto it&amp;rsquo;s own new window.</description>
