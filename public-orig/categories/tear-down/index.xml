      <description>One of my First Alert Carbon Monoxide Alarm&amp;rsquo;s expired. This gave me an opportunity to look inside and see what&amp;rsquo;s inside this little gadget.&#xA;Here is a picture of the tear-down for those who are interested:&#xA;First Alert - Single Station Carbon Monoxide Alarm - model #: CO614&#xA;The specification for the carbon-monoxide sensor used in this model can be found here.&#xA;Here is a list of alternative carbon-monoxide sensors from Figaro.</description>

      <description>While I was visiting Home Depot, I saw a Philips SlimStyle 60W LED bulb on clearance for two-dollars. I could not resist buying it for a tear-down to see how it&amp;rsquo;s built. I always wondered how they convert the 120VAC to a regulated DC voltage with high-current feed for lighting up those LED&amp;rsquo;s. So here is the first version of the tear-down showing you what&amp;rsquo;s inside the bulb. I will blog more about the current and voltage at the LED junction on a subsequent blog.</description>
