      <description>Most users are familiar with FTP, but if you want to kickstart Red Hat installs, PXE boot systems, auto-provision VoIP phones or unbrick a Linux-based router, you want a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server. Setting one up on Linux is easy, and a perfect project to take on over the weekend.&#xA;Source: Weekend Project: Set Up a TFTP Server on Linux | Linux.com | The source for Linux information</description>

      <description>Sometimes we have situations where you need to wait until one application is loaded that may bind to a certain port before kicking off a second application that may depend on that port. This process is typically described as &amp;ldquo;Wait-Until-Port-Opens&amp;rdquo; (or it could be the reverse - where you want to wait until a port closes).&#xA;Here are some use-cases for this method or script:&#xA;You have a Java web application (Jetty, Tomcat, WildFly, etc) that listens on port 8080 and you want your Nginx or Apache HTTPd server to start as a proxy-server once that back-end web server is bound to port 8080.</description>
