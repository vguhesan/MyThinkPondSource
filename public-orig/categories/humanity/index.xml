      <description>Dear Reader: I read this article on my cousin&amp;rsquo;s Facebook page (links below) and it was originally written in Tamil language. I was inspired when I read it and unfortunately Auto-Translate did not do a great job at translating this story and so this Thanks Giving - I wanted to translate this artcle into Engish so that the Engish-speaking readers can be inspired this Thanks Giving holiday of 2017. With a little bit of Encouragement and with Desire, Stength and Determination - all things are possible!</description>

      <description>Recently visited the Basilica of the National Shrine and each time I visit this beautiful place I&amp;rsquo;m spellbound. It is one of the hidden gems to visit when you are visiting the capital. Here are some pictures from my recent visit.&#xA;Click here for the photos from the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Michigan Avenue, Washington, DC. The beautiful murals are a work of art!</description>

      <description>Hello All:&#xA;I am writing today&amp;rsquo;s blog filled with tears and a sad heart to let the readers know that there are about 2 million people that are displaced in the city of Chennai, India today due to the recent massive floods. This flood is the worst seen in over 100 years in Chennai&amp;rsquo;s history. The last time this happened, Chennai (ancient city called Madrasapatinam) was not as densely populated as today (although we do not have actual numbers because census data is not available from 100 years ago).</description>
