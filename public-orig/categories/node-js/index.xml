      <description>Personally speaking, I prefer to have a self-contained bundle with all the artifacts and modules that might be required to deploy an application (not just Node.js application) in Production.

      <description>Lately there has been a lot of synergy and publicity around node.js (especially if you want to utilize the robust features of a JavaScript language on the server-side). If you are not familiar with this, I would suggest you look at the following link:&#xA;Node.js - Event-driven I/O server-side JavaScript environment based on V8.&#xA;If you are a Java developer and as you try out the examples, you will notice how this will be a great addition into your infrastructure.</description>
