      <description>Sometimes when compiling my Scala code, the compiler output may need a little bit of help in sorting out what&amp;rsquo;s the real issue.&#xA;For example, when I compiled today I received the following error:&#xA;[sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;jscript&amp;rdquo;]&#xA;[scalac] error: error while loading DefaultHttpClient, class file &amp;lsquo;C:\A_OpenSource\WicketNotesApp\lib\httpclient-4.0.jar(org/apache/http/impl/client/DefaultHttpClient.class)&amp;rsquo; is broken [scalac] (class net.jcip.annotations.ThreadSafe not found.)&#xA;[scalac] error: error while loading AbstractHttpClient, class file &amp;lsquo;C:\A_OpenSource\WicketNotesApp\lib\httpclient-4.0.jar(org/apache/http/impl/client/AbstractHttpClient.class)&amp;rsquo; is broken [scalac] (class net.jcip.annotations.ThreadSafe not found.)&#xA;[/sourcecode]&#xA;And my instinct tells me to focus on the jar file or the class file and in this case, &amp;ldquo;DefaultHttpClient.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we need to forward to a servlet or resource that&amp;rsquo;s outside of Wicket such as a servlet. Here&amp;rsquo;s how:&#xA;Modify your web.xml to define your servlet as well as your Wicket application &amp;ldquo;ignorePaths&amp;rdquo; init-param: [sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;xml&amp;rdquo;]&#xA;&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;UTF-8&#34;?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC &#34;-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN&#34; &#34;http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd&#34;&gt; Wicket Example MyApplication org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WicketFilter applicationClassName com.gu.MyApplication wicket.configuration deployment ignorePaths images/,s/ MyApplication /* SomeServlet com.gu.SomeServlet SomeServlet /s/koolkat.do [/sourcecode] The first observation is that Wicket is running as a Filter and not a Servlet.</description>

      <title>ContextPath in Apache Wicket</title>

      <description>One of the first things I found as I was getting familiar with Wicket is how do you point to resources that are part of a page. Well I did some digging around to find out so I&amp;rsquo;m documenting it here for others who might be facing the same challenges as they discover Apache Wicket.&#xA;Problem: You have pages in Wicket that are HTML with &amp;ldquo;Wicket&amp;rdquo; tags. But then you might want to point to resources such as CSS style sheets or JavaScript that&amp;rsquo;s part of a page.</description>

      <title>First Date with IntelliJ Community Edition and Scala</title>

      <description>Downloaded the Community Edition of IntelliJ a few days ago. Although most J2EE features are not available in the community edition, one of the features that did like was the Scala Plugin.&#xA;After I downloaded it and added the scala plug-in, I was very impressed with the tool. I have been using Eclipse (a little Netbeans) for most of my Java development and although I have tried the scala plugin that&amp;rsquo;s available for Eclipse, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t all that impressed.</description>
