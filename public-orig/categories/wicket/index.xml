      <description>PS: This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with deploying applications (war files) in Tomcat, setting up datasource\connection pooling using Apache DBCP and in using H2 Database.&#xA;Objective: Setup two instances of Brix-cms backed by a clustered Jackrabbit JCR on the back-end persisted onto a H2 database.&#xA;Because there is so much to cover, I will cover the pieces in three installments.&#xA;Installment #1:&#xA;What and why of Brix-cms.&#xA;Intro into why we care about Brix and JCR.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we need to forward to a servlet or resource that&amp;rsquo;s outside of Wicket such as a servlet. Here&amp;rsquo;s how:&#xA;Modify your web.xml to define your servlet as well as your Wicket application &amp;ldquo;ignorePaths&amp;rdquo; init-param: [sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;xml&amp;rdquo;]&#xA;&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;UTF-8&#34;?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC &#34;-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN&#34; &#34;http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd&#34;&gt; Wicket Example MyApplication org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WicketFilter applicationClassName com.gu.MyApplication wicket.configuration deployment ignorePaths images/,s/ MyApplication /* SomeServlet com.gu.SomeServlet SomeServlet /s/koolkat.do [/sourcecode] The first observation is that Wicket is running as a Filter and not a Servlet.</description>

      <description>One of the first things I found as I was getting familiar with Wicket is how do you point to resources that are part of a page. Well I did some digging around to find out so I&amp;rsquo;m documenting it here for others who might be facing the same challenges as they discover Apache Wicket.&#xA;Problem: You have pages in Wicket that are HTML with &amp;ldquo;Wicket&amp;rdquo; tags. But then you might want to point to resources such as CSS style sheets or JavaScript that&amp;rsquo;s part of a page.</description>
