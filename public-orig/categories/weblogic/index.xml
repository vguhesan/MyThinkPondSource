      <description>Has anyone experienced a similar issue? In tuning Weblogic 10.3 R27.6.0-50 for Windows, we were trying various values for the heap size.&#xA;Startup jRockit options:&#xA;[sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;jscript&amp;rdquo;] -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m [/sourcecode]&#xA;We were setting both values to the same.&#xA;1024m = worked 2048m = worked 3072m = did not work 4096m = worked&#xA;Did anyone experience a similar problem in allocating? Is there something special about 3072MB?&#xA;Update from Sept. 28th, 2010: When we tried this additional property in the start-up parameter the 3GB option works: -XxcompressedRefs=0</description>

      <description>In Weblogic, (on your development server or workstation), you might want to run it in &amp;ldquo;production mode&amp;rdquo; but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through and encrypt all the database passwords in the JDBC files for your development database servers.&#xA;Well, this article shows you how. Before you do this, make sure you are NOT doing this in a production environment. By doing this in a real-production environment, you may be compromising the security ofÂ your production infrastructure.</description>
